      <description>आजम खान की उत्तर प्रदेश विधानसभा की सदस्यता रद्द भड़काऊ भाषण मामले में तीन साल की सजा सुनाए जाने के एक दिन बाद शुक्रवार को समाजवादी पार्टी के वरिष्ठ नेता आजम खान की उत्तर प्रदेश विधानसभा की सदस्यता रद्द कर दी गई। उत्तर प्रदेश विधानसभा सचिवालय ने यह जानकारी दी। उत्तर प्रदेश विधानसभा के प्रधान सचिव प्रदीप दुबे ने पीटीआई-को बताया कि विधानसभा सचिवालय ने रामपुर सदर विधानसभा सीट को रिक्त घोषित कर दिया है।उन्होंने कहा, ‘‘अदालत द्वारा पारित फैसले के कारण अयोग्यता के परिणामस्वरूप उप्र विधानसभा सचिवालय द्वारा सीट रिक्त की घोषणा की गई है।’’ यह पूछे जाने पर कि क्या आजम खान को अयोग्य घोषित किया गया है, दुबे ने कहा, हम (एक मौजूदा सदस्य) अयोग्य घोषित नहीं करते हैं, हम केवल (संबंधित सीट की) रिक्ति की घोषणा करते हैं। अयोग्यता अदालत के आदेश से पहले ही हो चुकी है।’’वरिष्ठ सपा नेता खान ने हाल ही में संपन्न 2022 विधानसभा चुनावों में 10वीं बार रामपुर सीट से जीत हासिल की थी। विधायक चुने जाने पर खान ने रामपुर लोकसभा सीट से इस्तीफा दे दिया था। इस साल जून में, भाजपा के घनश्याम लोधी ने अपने निकटतम प्रतिद्वंद्वी कोउपचुनाव में 42,000 से अधिक मतों से हराकर समाजवादी पार्टी से रामपुर संसदीय सीट छीन ली थी। लोधी ने पार्टी नेता आजम खान के करीबी माने जाने वाले सपा उम्मीदवार मोहम्मद असीम राजा को हराया था, जो 2019 में निर्वाचन क्षेत्र से जीते थे।उत्तर प्रदेश विधानसभा के लिए चुने जाने के बाद आजम खान के इस्तीफे के कारण उपचुनाव हुआ था। शुक्रवार को इस बीच, उप्र के उपमुख्यमंत्री केशव प्रसाद मौर्य ने एक ट्वीट कर प्रतिक्रिया व्यक्त करते हुए कहा, मोहम्मद आज़म खान की विधानसभा सदस्यता रद्द करने के माननीय अध्यक्ष विधानसभा श्री सतीश महाना के फ़ैसले का स्वागत है। रिक्त विधानसभा के उपचुनाव जब भी होंगे,भाजपा का कमल खिलेगा!</description>
