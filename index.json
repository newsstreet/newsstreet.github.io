In essence, it will likely be very similar to the privacy controls and indicators found on Android 12 and 13. When your camera or microphone is active, you may be notified so that you can choose whether or not to deactivate it to protect yourself against snooping from apps or websites. Placing this type of granular control in the hands of the user is a trend that’s picked up a lot over the past few years as companies like Google and Apple face scrutiny in congress. Per our friend C2 Productions on Twitter , the Privacy Hub indicators are beginning to appear on the Chromebook shelf as seen below. They are currently inoperable, but in time when they release to the public on the Stable channel of Google’s operating system, I imagine one or multiple of the indicators will appear once a camera, microphone, or screen sharing is active and clicking it will toggle said icon to cut off access to that part of the device entirely. C2 Productions @cr_c2cv @chromeunboxed @GabrielBrangers @jojothetechie @robby_payne @michaelperrigo The Privacy Hub, just improved by introducing these buttons on the shelf (Weird Placement!).

They do light up https://t.co/2M65S5lh3z 8:50 PM · Oct 28, 2022 2 1 In other reports, we’ve seen green status indicators appearing on the shelf as well, so it’s my opinion that this is exactly what it is. I’d be interested in hearing your thoughts – are you surprised that such a feature never existed before now? I sure am, but I’m glad it’s being implemented now.

On a seamer-friendly surface at the Perth Stadium, South Africa would be tempted to unleash a four-pronged pace attack harnessing Lungi Ngidi with Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada , and Wayne Parnell. On the other hand, India would be tempted to strengthen their batting line-up by adding Deepak Hooda in place of Axar Patel . Indian Express also argues for the inclusion of Reeza Hendricks in place of the struggling South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma.

Premium Experts Explain: How not to deal with China Subscribe now at less than Rs 4/day With four left-handed batters in South Africa’s top seven, it is highly unlikely that India will play Axar Patel against South Africa. Axar Patel has bowled well against the Netherlands but the Indian team management will most likely give batting all-rounder Deepak Hooda a game. Hooda is a proper batter and can chip in with a couple of overs with his off-spin. Hooda is more than a useful bowler. Ngidi for Shamsi Tabraiz Shamsi was impressive in South Africa’s thumping 104-run win over Bangladesh but is highly unlikely to retain his spot in the playing XI. South Africa will most likely add Lungi Ngidi to make the pace attack more fearsome and challenge Indian batters. Other things which might go against Shamsi is his poor record against India and also given the fact that Indian batters will be at ease facing him rather than a quick. Hendricks for Bavuma Skipper Temba Bavuma is the weakest link otherwise a formidable South African squad. If South Africa drop Temba Bavuma, they might end up winning the title. Temba Bavuma’s career strike rate is 115.41. He has crossed fifty only once in the 30 T20Is. Reeza Hendricks, another player of colour, someone who is in red-hot form, is warming the bench. Hendricks is having a cracker of a year in T20s with an average of 42 and a strike rate of 144. India vs South Africa Head-to-Head India is ahead when it comes to the head-to-head battle 13-9 against South Africa in T20Is. In the T20 World Cup games, India has won 4 games so far, and the African nation has won just a solitary game. India vs South Africa Pitch Report Advertisement The pitch will suit the pacers. Both the teams will keep a close eye on the first match between Pakistan and Netherlands, which will be played on the same surface. Hard lengths are the way to go in Perth.

The Prime Minister appealed for people to check facts before sharing messages on social media. Addressing a 'Chintan Shivir' in Haryana of home ministers of states via video conferencing, PM Modi said, \"For the safety and rights of law-abiding citizens, stringent action against negative forces is our responsibility. A small piece of fake news can kick up a storm across the nation...We will have to educate people to think before forwarding anything, verify before believing it...\" He said people must be made aware of the various mechanisms that are now available on all social media platforms to verify messages before forwarding them. \"Fact check of fake news is a must. Technology plays a big role in this. People must be made aware of mechanisms to verify messages before forwarding them,\" the prime minister said. Prime Minister said that one should not limit social media to being the source of information. He said that a piece of single fake news has the capability to snowball into a matter of national concern. The Prime Minister said during the reservation issue, the country had to face losses due to fake news. He said people should think 10 times before forwarding any messages on social media. He stressed on the need to educate people about analysing and verifying information before forwarding it on social media platforms. Emphasizing on the internal security of the country, Prime Minister said India needs to defeat the threats that are arising from Naxalism be it \"gun-toting or pen-wielding\". \"In past few years, all governments have acted responsibly to demolish ground network of terror...We need to handle it by combining our forces. We will have to defeat all forms of Naxalism - be it gun-totting or pen-wielding, we will have to find a solution for all of them,\" PM said.

Commending the increase in penetration of digital payments in the country, Modi said that women entrepreneurs of the village are accepting digital payments with Paytm and have QR codes outside their shops.The Prime Minister was addressing a rally after laying the foundation stone of various developmental projects at Mana village, which is considered the last village at the border between India and China, during his two-day state visit last week. Digital payments pioneer Paytm has been at the forefront of India's digital revolution and is widely used across the country from small villages to bigger cities and towns. The company pioneered the QR code revolution in India. From offline payment devices to credit, Paytm is enabling merchants with robust business solutions to scale their businesses. The company has disbursed 9.2 million loans in the second quarter of FY23, registering a 224 per cent YoY growth in volume. Meanwhile, the total value of loans disbursed during the quarter grew 482 per cent YoY to Rs 7,313 crore ($894 million). Paytm has further strengthened its leadership in offline payments with the number of devices deployed exceeding 4.8 million as of Q2 FY23, with over 1 million new deployments during the second quarter. The company said it is committed to its mission of driving financial inclusion in the country and bringing half a billion unserved and underserved Indians to the mainstream economy.

(Nasdaq: MU), and the Micron Foundation, along with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, have announced a new partnership with the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), committing to a joint investment of $10 million to fund and develop semiconductor curricula in colleges and universities across the country. NSF will match the Micron Foundation’s initial donation of $5 million over the next five years, enabling the development of high-quality educational material, offering educators options for professional development and providing students with experiential opportunities in the semiconductor industry. Micron and NSF will work together to direct the funds towards these programs and towards innovative academic research in the high technology memory field. Broadening access to and strengthening the quality of semiconductor instruction in U.S. higher education institutions will help to expand and diversify not only America’s semiconductor industry, but also the workforce of the future. “This new cross-sector partnership will help American innovation keep pace with a changing global innovation landscape,” said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “The historic passage of the “CHIPS and Science Act,” is allowing NSF to help keep American technology innovation on the cutting edge and ensure cutting-edge industries are made in America.” “Working together, the business community, academia and the public sector can create new pathways to careers for students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds,” said April Arnzen, Micron’s chief people officer and president of the Micron Foundation. “We’re looking forward to growing our partnership with NSF and reaching students across America – whether they’re enrolled at a minority-serving institution, research university or community college – as they advance America’s technological leadership and scientific innovation.” “When I wrote my Endless Frontier Act which eventually became the CHIPS and Science bill, it was innovative partnerships between companies like Micron and the National Science Foundation that I had top of mind,” said Senator Schumer. “We are bringing together the best and the brightest, and programs like this are how we breathe new life into our nation’s manufacturing future and prepare the next generation with the skills and education they need to take us into tomorrow. This investment will help ensure America remains on the cutting-edge of new innovations and that our workforce is ready for the good-paying jobs building our future in the communities that need them most, including Upstate NY, and I am proud to have paved the way to make it happen.” Micron’s NSF partnership closely follows Micron’s recently announced historic $500 million investment, in partnership with the state of New York, in community and workforce development. Aimed at expanding and preparing Central New York’s workforce for Micron’s new leading-edge memory megafab, which will be built in Clay, New York, the fund will be used for workforce training, education programs, housing and other community investments. Micron aims to hire a diverse workforce in the region, and to accelerate economic opportunity for underserved communities in the semiconductor industry.

ROCK HILL, SOUTH CAROLINA, USA, October 28, 2022 /EINPresswire.com/ — Monday, October 31st, 2022, is the deadline to report IFTA for the third quarter. It is important to do this as soon as possible to avoid getting fined. Reporting IFTA is required by drivers of vehicles weighing more than 26,000 pounds, having three or more axles, and traveling through two or more jurisdictions. Drivers and motor carriers report fuel purchases and miles traveled in each jurisdiction to their base jurisdiction quarterly. Once IFTA is filed, the base jurisdiction can then distribute the taxes to each jurisdiction where the fuel was purchased in. It is important to keep track of fuel receipts and miles traveled in each jurisdiction in order to generate an accurate IFTA report. Normally one would have to keep track of IFTA tax rates because rates are subject to change every quarter and then do all of the calculations manually. This process can take a lot of time, and the IFTA could end up being filed late and will be subject to late fees. To ensure that this does not happen, TruckLogics does all of the calculations and keeps track of IFTA tax rate changes. Drivers simply have to enter their information either manually, through a provided excel template, or via Motive for those who have a Motive subscription. TruckLogics will then generate IFTA reports in state-specific formats. If a state does not accept the paper filing, TruckLogics will provide an e-filing worksheet that will help drivers e-file their IFTA with their base jurisdiction. Generate a file-ready IFTA report now at TruckLogics.com, where the tax rates are automatically calculated. TruckLogics, a leading Trucking Management Software, has helped hundreds of trucking fleets streamline their business operations with both the full TMS and its convenient IFTA-only option. By using TruckLogics as a Trucking Management Software, truckers can create loads, dispatches, invoices, track income, and expenses, manage truck maintenance, pay drivers, and much more. There is a no-obligation 15-day free trial available for those who want to try out TruckLogics and see if the Trucking Management Solution is right for them. IFTA reporting is also available but only with the subscription of a preferred or premium plan. When asked about the third quarter IFTA deadline, Agie Sundaram, the CEO, and Co-founder of SPAN Enterprises, the parent company of TruckLogics, responded, “With the third quarter IFTA deadline just days away, TruckLogics can help simplify the IFTA reporting process with its user-friendly format and convenient features. Our live support team is here to answer any questions you may have to make sure your IFTA report is generated before the deadline.” SPAN Enterprises, the parent company of TruckLogics, creates industry-leading solutions for IRS tax e-filing and the transportation industry.

The incident took place on Friday, October 28, after the girls bunked their school in the Sehore district and travelled a distance of 100 km to Indore. \"While two of the girls died, the condition of another girl, who is undergoing treatment in MY Hospital, is critical,\" Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Prashant Choubey said. \"From the preliminary investigation and the statement of the girl who survived, it emerged that the trio was studying in the same school in Ashta town of Sehore and were very close friends,\" he said, as per a report by PTI. \"They skipped their class to catch a bus to Indore on Friday morning. The girls reached Indore as the boyfriend of one of them lived there. She wanted to meet him as he had stopped taking her calls. Therefore, she had decided to go to Indore to meet him personally,\" Choubey added. The officer continued narrating, \"She had decided that if her boyfriend does not meet her, she will end her life along with her two friends. The trio had procured poison from a shop in Ashta and one of them tried to contact the boy after reaching Indore. They waited for the boy in a park near the Bhawarkuan area, but when he did not turn up, the heartbroken girl consumed poison.\" He informed further, \"Immediately afterwards, one of her friends also consumed poison and told the surviving girl that she was facing serious problems in her family. The last girl followed suit as she was very close to her two friends. However, the last girl survived,\" as noted by PTI. The police officer said that when the people around the girls noticed them, they rushed the trio to a nearby private hospital, from where they were shifted to MY Hospital. However, two of them passed away there. \"We are relying on the statement of the girl, who is undergoing treatment, which has become the basis of our investigation,\" Choubey informed. \"No suicide note was recovered from the girls. The parents of the girls have reached Indore and their statements will be recorded,\" he added.\nedexlive\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/madhya-pradesh-three-school-girls-consume-poison-two-dead-one-critical/","tags":[],"title":"Madhya Pradesh: Three school girls consume poison; two dead, one critical"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"ATK Mohun Bagan vs Emami East Bengal Preview: Age-old rivalry on Calcutta soil for the first time in ISL sportstar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/atk-mohun-bagan-vs-emami-east-bengal-preview-age-old-rivalry-on-calcutta-s/","tags":[],"title":"ATK Mohun Bagan vs Emami East Bengal Preview: Age-old rivalry on Calcutta soil for the first time in ISL"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"IND vs SA: \u0026lsquo;As a pace attack\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;, South Africa\u0026rsquo;s Anrich Nortje WARNS India batters ahead of T20 World Cup 2022 clash IND vs SA: South African pacer Anrich Nortje has made a BIG statement on clash with Indian batters ahead of T20 World Cup 2022 match\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/ind-vs-sa-as-a-pace-attack-south-africas-anrich-nortje-warns-india-/","tags":[],"title":"IND vs SA: 'As a pace attack...', South Africa's Anrich Nortje WARNS India batters ahead of T20 World Cup 2022 clash"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Five school students go missing in Salem district after phoning and telling parents not to look for them A special police team has been formed to look for the boys; school authorities said the children hadn’t come in after Deepavali\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/five-school-students-go-missing-in-salem-district-after-phoning-and-telling/","tags":[],"title":"Five school students go missing in Salem district after phoning and telling parents not to look for them"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Perth weather forecast IND SA: Will rain play spoilsport during India vs South Africa T20 World Cup match IND vs SA Perth weather: Here’s all you need to know about the weather in Perth ahead of the India vs South Africa 2022 T20 World Cup match.\nsportstar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/perth-weather-forecast-ind-sa-will-rain-play-spoilsport-during-india-vs-so/","tags":[],"title":"Perth weather forecast IND SA: Will rain play spoilsport during India vs South Africa T20 World Cup match"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Madonna goes BOLD on social media, strikes a nude pose!

If you want fuss-free, custom-fit earbuds, you need to know about them.\n How often does your tech teach you something completely new about your physicality? For me, rarely – especially when said revelation pertains to the very thing that earns me the bulk of my income these days, my ears and testing the best wireless headphones on the market. But today was not a normal day. The illuminating product (and I mean that literally as well as metaphorically) is UE's Fits earbuds, which have been available in the US for a little while but just arrived across the pond in the UK. UE, also known as Ultimate Ears, is a loveable Californian audio giant that can lay claim to some of the best Bluetooth speakers we've had the pleasure of testing – see the Wonderboom 2 as a fine example. Now, the need-to-know info here is that these earbuds involve a custom-fitting process, but they do all of the tailoring while you wait – no audiologist, no two-part silicon kit, no shipping off impressions, no long wait to get your earpieces. Remember ideas like Avery's custom ear-tips to solve your terrible AirPods fit? This is nothing like that. This is not a great photo. But look at the purple glow from my very warm ears! (Image credit: Future) What you do is: download the UE Fit app, take the earbuds out of their slightly intimidating, sterile-feel packaging, put them in the case, and follow the prompts. The whole thing takes about three minutes. And the results blew my mind. It wasn't a great start. Upon inserting the earbuds into my ears, the translucent tips (which actually cover the whole of the driver housing proper) were far too big for my ears. However, the app reassured me I could hold them in place while the magical fitting sorcery happened. This is the part that'll really wow you. The app warns you it's about to happen, but still, I'll wager you've never experienced anything quite like it. You only get one shot at this, but the parts of the earpiece that rest inside your ear heat up while you wear them. Almost immediately, I could feel the thermoplastic moving, slimming down, caressing and assimilating with the folds of my ears. At the end of it all, UE asks if you'd like to snap a selfie (at which point you notice they're illuminated purple), and although I usually balk at the very idea of that, on this occasion I took the plunge. And so help me, I posted it above…\nA lesson in physics: achieve an optimum fit, reap the rewards (Image credit: Future) It almost makes me sad that in one set of UE Fits' lifespan, they will probably only be required to perform this transformative heat-up dance once. It seems a shame when you ponder the considerable effort that must have gone into squirreling those powerful heat elements away inside the driver housings! I'm almost tempted to order more tips (which is possible and presumably offered in case you messed up first time around) for $30. As I decide if I want to buy them just to do the test all over again for fun, I should note that they're light-sensitive, so UE warns you to keep them in their pill packet until you're ready to go for it. Nothing I've tried before, not even the best true wireless earbuds, has boasted this particular feature. I'm honestly flabbergasted more hasn't been made of it. As any audiophile will tell you if you let them, only when a decent seal betwixt ear-tip and ear canal is achieved can the sonic talents of any earbuds or in-ear monitors truly shine. And that's what happens here. Now Fontaines D.C.'s Bloomsday sounds especially angry, somber, brooding, and downright dissonant and jagged. It's a lesson in physics: get the fit right, reap the rewards. Can we just talk about the state of the right ear though? (Image credit: Future) This is not a full review of the UE Fits (that will take time) but other features worth noting are a single dynamic 10mm driver in each earpiece, up to eight hours of continuous listening on a single charge, and \"over 20 hours of playback\" using extra juice from the case. You can play/pause music and answer calls directly from the earbuds, and you can customize the earbud control buttons using the UE FITS app to activate your voice assistant, skip tracks, or control volume. With strategically-positioned dual microphones, UE tells me that the earphones are designed to reduce wind noise and enhance call clarity in any situation. What I know so far is they fit so well I never have to fiddle with them during use, which is unheard of. OK, I'll say it: I'm shocked at how oddly small and sort of squished my right custom tip looks compared to the nice oval left one. This isn't a complaint, though; I love how they fit. I just… never knew that's how dodgy my right ear looks inside. Anyway, nobody sees that once it's in my ear, right? Best to put them back in then… See? This is all they'll see when I wear them (thankfully) (Image credit: Future) \ntechradar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/i-tried-ues-automatic-heat-to-fit-earbuds-and-theyre-a-revelation/","tags":[],"title":"I tried UE's automatic heat-to-fit earbuds and they're a revelation"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Apple @ Work: iMessage could be a strong business communication tool if Apple expanded it to other platforms Apple at Work is bought to you by Jamf: Get complete management and security solutions for your organization that are enterprise secure, consumer simple, and protect personal privacy with Jamf.

Between the two films, a little over Rs. 60 crores have come in between Tuesday and Friday. Of course, a lot more was expected considering the Diwali period and ideally at least Rs. 100 crores should have been crossed by now. However, that hasn't happened and now it's about when does Rs. 100 crores come in between the two films. As things look currently, it looks like at best Rs. 90 crores would be crossed by the end of weekend and then Rs. 100 crores would be hit during the weekdays. Let's talk about Ram Setu first. The film has collected Rs. 41.45 crores in 4 days and the total so far is better than all Akshay Kumar films that have released in 2022. These are indeed different times and basically survival is the key. So far, it's his Samrat Prithviraj which has seen the best lifetime when compared to all other releases as it scored Rs. 68.05 crores. Now that total will definitely be surpassed and while Rs. 80 crores should come calling, it has to be seen how much further to that does the film go in the long run. On Thursday, the film collected Rs. 6.05 crores. As for Thank God, it has surprisingly not managed to collect at all. On Friday, the numbers were really low at Rs. 3.30 crores and considering that this is just the fourth day of the film's run, one wonders how audiences have just not been giving it a dekko. Of course, the trending is on the same lines as Ram Setu but then it opened at almost half the numbers on Tuesday and it's the same ratio that is being followed right till the fourth day.

The Prime Minister said that even though law and order are the responsibility of the states as per the Constitution, they are equally related to the unity and integrity of the country. \"Every state should learn from each other, take inspiration from each other, work for the betterment of the country, this is the spirit of the Constitution and it is also our responsibility towards the countrymen,\" the Prime Minister said. Referring to the ongoing 'Amrit Kaal', the Prime Minister said that during the Amrit Kaal, an Amrit generation will emerge carrying the essence of the 'Panch Pran' - advance with greater conviction and the determination of a developed India; get rid of any signs of slavery; take pride in India's history; the power of unity; duties of citizens, such as those of the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers. \"The 'Panch Pran' must be the guiding force for good governance,\" said the Prime Minister. He said that when the strength of the country increases, then the power of every citizen and every family in the country will get a boost. \"This is good governance where benefits reach even the last person standing in the queue in every state,\" he said. Modi emphasized the link between the law-and-order system and the development of the states. \"It is very important for the entire law-and-order system to be reliable. Its trust and perception among the public are very important,\" he pointed out. He noted the growing identity of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) during times of natural calamities. Similarly, the arrival of police at the spot of a crime is taken as the arrival of the government and the police's reputation got a boost during the Corona period as well, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister stressed that there is no dearth of commitment and perception of the police needs to be further strengthened. \"Guiding them in this regard should be our ongoing process,\" Modi emphasized. The Prime Minister pointed out that crime is no longer localized and instances of inter-state and international crimes are going up. \"That is why mutual cooperation between state agencies and between Central and state agencies is becoming crucial,\" he said. He pointed out that whether it is cybercrime or the use of drone technologies for the smuggling of weapons or drugs, the government needs to keep working towards new technologies to tackle the menace. \"The law and order system can be improved with the help of smart technology,\" the Prime Minister remarked. He said that 5G, along with its benefits, brings the need for a heightened alert and requested the Chief Ministers and state Home Ministers to \"seriously assess the need for technology, going beyond the constraints of the budget as this technology will percolate the confidence of security among common citizens\". The Prime Minister mentioned that the Police Technology Mission of the Central government and stressed the need for a common platform as differing technologies of different states do not talk to each other. \"We should have a pan-India outlook, all our best practices should be interoperable and should have a common link,\" Modi said. The Prime Minister later asked the state agencies to develop capabilities in forensic science and take full advantage of the National Forensic Sciences University of Gandhinagar.

All her fans and family members are eagerly waiting for the arrival of her and 's baby. It is being reported that the actress will be delivering the baby in a month's time. The unconfirmed media reports claim that Alia and Ranbir's baby will share the birthday month with the actress' sister Shaleen and the speculated delivery date is close to Nov 28. However, there has been no information transmitted about the same by the Bollywood celebrities. Alia Bhatt, who got married to Ranbir Kapoor in April this year announced her pregnancy through social media in June and since then the actress is grabbing the eyeballs about the same. Many speculated that the actress had already conceived before she got married and hence the hush hush ceremonies. When the same was asked to Alia's sister Shaheen, she told a media portal, “I will not speak for her (Alia) because that is her own journey. Anything that she has dealt with internally is completely her journey. Having said that, you can never really please everybody. There is always going to be a negative comment or two out there. And I think living in the public eye, we are all very practised at knowing what to pay heed to and what not to focus on.” Meanwhile, Alia has been unstoppable after the pregnancy announcement. From her pregnancy outfits, footwear and to launching her own line of maternity wear, the actress is leaving no stone unturned to flaunt her pregnancy and talk about it during the promotional events or award ceremonies. Just after the announcement of her pregnancy, the 'Gangubai Kathiawadi' actress was seen promoting her film 'Darlings' in which she opened up about the stress during pregnancy and gave her precious piece of advice to continue working even during this period. Likewise, during the acceptance speech after being honoured with Time100 Impact award, the actress mentioned how the baby 'relentlessly kicked' her throughout her speech. She also talked at length about it during the promotional events of her recent projects, including 'Darlings' and 'Brahmastra: Part One - Shiva'. More recently, she also took to her Instagram handle to show the collection of her maternity wear. On the movies front, Alia, who was last seen in Netflix film Darlings looks forward to a slew of new releases namely -- Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani, Jee Le Zara and her Hollywood debut film Heart of Stone.\nindiatvnews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/alia-bhatts-delivery-date-revealed-ranbir-kapoors-baby-likely-to-share-b/","tags":[],"title":"Alia Bhatt's delivery date revealed?

This time around, the perpetrator is none other than Amazon, as according to TechCrunch, cybersecurity researcher Anurag Sen recently discovered a major Amazon database, no password protection whatsoever, available to anyone who knew where to look. With the help of Shodan - a search engine for internet-connected things, Sen discovered the database, named Sauron, and found it full of Amazon Prime viewing habits.\nDeployment error In total, the database held some 215 million entries of pseudonymized viewing data - meaning while there’s plenty of data on specific customers to learn about their viewing habits, it’s virtually impossible to connect those accounts with actual identities. Sauron contains things such as movie/series name, the device used to stream the content, network quality, customer subscription plan, etc. The database was reportedly first detected to be exposed in late September 2022, after which Amazon was tipped off, and removed the system from the wider web.\n“There was a deployment error with a Prime Video analytics server. This problem has been resolved and no account information (including login or payment details) were exposed.

On Friday, the movie dropped by 25 percent, which isn't exactly a healthy trend for a film of this budget and star cast. According to early estimates, Ram Setu has collected in the range of Rs. 6.50 to 7.00 crore on its fourth day, taking the total collection to around Rs. 42 crores. These are low numbers for Ram Setu given the Diwali weekend and the prime reason for the below-the-mark result so far is the fact that the film isn't getting any sort of support from the metro audience. Whatever the film has earned to date is on the strength of the Diwali Holidays and mass audience. As the holiday factor is going down, the numbers too are seeing a steep fall. A double-digit on either Saturday or Sunday is now unlikely, as the film won't see big gains over the weekend given the trend so far. In a best-case scenario, the first weekend (6 days) will be around Rs. 58 crores, and from there, it will be the hold on Monday which will decide the long-term fate. The drop on Friday has put a full stop to the chances of the film hitting a century at the box office, but yet, it's not all over yet.

However, many of the stars aren't bright enough to shine through at the wavelengths MIRI focuses on.NASA says that, with this image, astronomers have mid-infrared light data at higher resolution than has been available in the past. The agency notes that researchers will look at more precise dust movements to form a fuller 3D landscape of the Pillars of Creation. This will help to develop a deeper understanding of how stars form.The Pillars of Creation is in the Eagle Nebula, some 6,500 light years away. In case you're wondering how vast the whole thing is, take a look at the bright red star that juts out from the right side of the top pillar, around halfway up. NASA says the star and its dusty shroud are bigger than our entire solar system, which may or may not spark an existential crisis or two. Have a wonderful Halloween weekend.Hauntingly beautiful in any light, we can’t help but return to the Pillars of Creation over and over. And each time, we deepen our understanding of this region.

The employee representative bodies were notified in advance. The purpose of these proceedings is to evaluate all solutions that could enable the Company to continue its business activity, maintain employment, and pay off its liabilities under the best possible conditions, and also to initiate a process to attract investors within the framework of a recovery plan by way of continuation or a sale plan. The Company will continue its current activities during the observation period. The Company will inform the financial markets of the decision of the Montpellier Commercial Court. Under these conditions, DEINOVE has asked Euronext to suspend the listing of its shares (ISIN: FR0010879056) on Euronext Growth from October 28 before the opening of trading, pending the publication of a press release and until further notice. Given the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the steps taken by the Company, the suspension of the listing of the Company’s shares (ISIN: FR0010879056) is maintained until further notice. ABOUT DEINOVE DEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life, unexplored at 99.9%: the “microbial dark matter”. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable, it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance. The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed. This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10,000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today, DEINOVE is conducting several development programs, of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infection, one of the world’s first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis. Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier, DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH® (ALDEI – code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has 45 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic, technological, industrial and institutional partners.

As per the probe agencies, the four murders were committed by the same group.Shah also said that such murders have taken place in Pakistan too, mentioning the violent deaths of politician Salman Taseer and rights activist Sabeen Mehmood.\"In Iran, thousands of girls have put their lives at stake while carrying on an agitation against the Hijab law. We consider ourselves lucky that we lived in this time,\" Shah said.The actor conceded that he was not much aware of Dabholkar's work when he was alive. After learning about him after his murder, \"I was astonished that here was a man who put his convictions before his life\", he said.The actor also mentioned the \"Maulavi\" of his childhood who used to teach them \"nonsense\" like earth does not revolve around the sun. To fight superstition, we need the same conviction as these people who preach irrational ideas, Shah said.The actor also narrated a parable by renowned Hindi writer Harishankar Parsai, a sarcastic take on the nature of politics in electoral democracy.Earlier, reminiscing about her late husband, Dr Shaila Dabholkar said his motto was \"to fight is to win\" and \"action\" was important. This attitude helped her when she got involved in work related to de-addiction and mental health, she said.Asked about the several threats that Dabholkar received during his lifetime, she said he never thought about fear of death.Lawyer Abhav Nevagi, who is representing the Dabholkar family in the cases related to his murder, said the legal battle has witnessed many a turn and twist.At one point, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) told the court that the bullets which formed evidence would be sent to Scotland Yard for expert opinion, but later the central agency told the court that there is no agreement between the Indian government and the UK authorities to enable such sharing of evidence. In the process, 10 months were wasted, he said.The CBI has arrested five persons in the Dabholkar murder case, two of whom are out on bail. The trial in the case is going on before a court in Pune.\nnationalheraldindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/narendra-dabholkars-footprints-would-only-deepen-proud-to-have-lived-in-s/","tags":["National","India"],"title":"Narendra Dabholkar's footprints would only deepen; proud to have lived in same era as him: Naseeruddin Shah"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Natural Gas Storage Site In The UK Reopens Ahead Of A Difficult Winter UK energy firm Centrica reopened its Rough natural gas storage site on Friday — which was closed five years ago — to boost storage capacity by 50% for this winter.

Despite the controversy, the game has got a good share of publicity, not to mention in both ways, positive as well as negative. Keeping the 30FPS console talks aside, the game in itself has some bugs and stability issues even for PC. Now, a new patch has been released for the PC that aims at improving all the stability and performance issues. Gotham Knights’ new patch for PC aims as fixing stability issues Gotham Knights for PC is now getting its first patch that is said to fix several issues in general and Co-op mode. It also addresses stability issues and UI fixes. Calling all Knights! Thank you to the Community for your continued support of #GothamKnights. It's amazing to see the game live and in your hands! As we begin to roll out Patches, we'd like to outline what to expect in the coming weeks as well as clarify some things: (1/7) — Gotham Knights (@GothamKnights) October 26, 2022 Here are the patch notes. General: Invincible enemies playing a “meditating” animation will no longer appear in crimes. Various UI issue fixes. Fixed issues caused by graphical settings not being applied properly. Various localization fixes. Fixed various Keyboard/Mouse specific input issues. Co-op: Fixed an issue that was preventing being able to join friends through invites. Stability: Various crash fixes throughout the title, most notably during the S.T.A.R Labs “free the scientists” fight and Harley Quinn Hospital Boss Fight. Fixed an AMD specific crash related to shadows. Known Issues: There may be some compatibility issues with Nvidia Ansel that we are still investigating for this patch. In addition to this, Gotham Knights players for consoles are assured that there’s a patch incoming. The patch, similar to the PC, will fix several issues in the game for consoles. Nothing specific has been revealed. On PC, however, gamers can enjoy 60fps in the high preset with cards like Nvidia RTX 2070 or equivalent and a higher-end CPU. If you still haven’t played the game, you can check the full system requirements for PC here and perhaps enjoy it this weekend.

SATURDAY FARE spoke to a couple of fashion designers to capture the essence of stylish festive wear\nAs north easterners we are blessed with a wide range of textiles that can be (and are being) crafted to fusion garments (blending traditional styles with contemporary trends). \"Such pieces are often statement pieces in festival dos. For instance a muga wraparound embellished with antique designs crafted by some indigenous hill tribe is guaranteed to arrest attentionThe time has finally come for festival outfits. And this festival season is indeed special as after a lull of two years, people are celebrating with 'unmasked' gusto. The long Indian festival calendar that starts in August and continues until April is marked by numerous festivals that have myriad customs and traditions. Therefore it is always nice to dress in a manner that is befitting to the customs and traditions of the specific festival that you are celebrating. And since the festival season excludes the harsh summer and monsoon months in our tropical subcontinent, people do have a greater number of options in terms of the textures and colours of apparel. Saturday Fare spoke to a couple of fashion designers to capture the essence of stylish festive wear. \"Some things are staple in festive fashion wear,\" says Mriganka Sharma a city based fashion designer. \"For instance the lehenga can always be complemented with a shirt and flaunted at a pre-Diwali do. It's best to choose a bright coloured ethnic looking lehenga and go for a shirt (to be tucked in) in a neutral or contrasting colour. For instance an orange lehenga will go well with black or even beige. A long jacket with palazzo pants on the other hand is a great bet for a Vishwakarma Puja outing. In my opinion a kurta with dhoti pants, salwar kurta sets and saris are appropriate for Durga Puja,\" she observes. Mriganka says that in festive fashion wear 'old is gold'. \"While you can definitely shop for your attire in high end stores, designer boutiques and even flea markets remember that nothing beats the feeling of flaunting your mother's favourite silk sari with a dainty brocade border. This is probably one of the saris in her wardrobe that you fancied as a small girl and hoped to wear one day. Wearing your grandmother's cherished gold stud earrings is yet another unparalleled feeling that makes your celebration memorable,\" she elaborates. Madhumita Das another fashion designer agrees to this vein of reasoning and states, \"The underlying fact is that festivals are time for family bonding and revelries. Therefore they should be memorable and also evoke nostalgia.\" While the prescribed and recommended colour palette for festival wear is infinite one must be wary of certain colours that contrast with the festive vibes. \"Black is one such colour actually,\" says Madhumita. \"I would say that the thumb rule is to steer away from an 'only black' attire. In other words, refrain from wearing a black attire that is not interrupted with colourful patterns. Yes you can choose a black top or blouse with a bright coloured skirt or sari. But even here it is advisable to have a few colourful embellishments on the black,\" she advises. \"Relatively pale colours like mauve and lemon yellow somehow does not complement Indian festival wear. These colours too should be worn when complemented with contrasting colours. Red, maroon, orange, rust, purple and the more exuberant shades of green, blue and pink rarely go wrong in Indian festival wear,\" says Mriganka. For festivals one can experiment a little more (than in the regular days) with respect to one's fashion statement. \"For instance you might want to drape your sari in a way that you have never draped before or might want to flaunt a hairstyle or some statement earring that you fancied while watching a favourite Netflix series. Well just go ahead (but remember not to overdo or go overboard) and flaunt with style and confidence. However, if you are sporting a completely different (and new for you) hairstyle, lip colour or outfit do remember to incorporate some familiar elements too. For instance a purple lipstick will translate to admiring eyeballs if you retain your signature eye makeup. Changing both might translate to an unwanted spectacle so refrain from it,\" says Madhumita and adds, \"Whimsical yet comfortable (both in terms of physical comfort and psychological ease) is the fashion mantra for Indian festivals.\" Both Madhumita and Mriganka agree that as north easterners we are blessed with a wide range of textiles that can be (and are being) crafted to fusion garments (blending traditional styles with contemporary trends). \"Such pieces are often statement pieces in festival dos. For instance a muga wraparound embellished with antique designs crafted by some indigenous hill tribe is guaranteed to arrest attention. Tribe inspired jewelleriers and accessories too are a great hit but try to restrict these pieces for the pre-festival dos. In my view, for the main festival it is best to embrace the tried and tested pieces when it comes to jewelleriers and accessories. Small and dainty pieces in gold, silver and even brass will always complement your traditional festival outfit,\" says Mriganka. In addition to these ornate materials, the precious and semi precious pieces are also always a go to choice. While most people get excited about apparel and jewellery during festivals many according to Madhumita forget about the importance of matching/ complementing footwear and bags. \"While clutch bags are great for festival outfits you can also go for a range of traditional sling bags and leather bags. But always use your discretion and ensure that your bag and footwear complement your outfit,\" she says and concludes, \"Also pay attention to your makeup and avoid a caked up and overdone look at all costs. While attire and accessories can be ornate it is recommended to stick to your usual makeup regime during festivals.\"Also Read: Making Indelible Connections and Creating Impressions through MusicAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/festival-fashionto-or-not-to-bring-on-the-bling/","tags":["Life,Saturday Fare,Supplements,More"],"title":"Festival Fashion…to or not to Bring on the Bling?"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Red Bull agree terms with FIA over cost cap breach indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/red-bull-agree-terms-with-fia-over-cost-cap-breach/","tags":["Sports"],"title":"Red Bull agree terms with FIA over cost cap breach"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Coimbatore blast: Why did it take four days to bring in NIA, asks T.N.

SATURDAY FARE provides you a detailed overview\nThe use of lighting can add to or subtract from the overall colours of a room. Darker colours make a room feel smaller and cramped, while light-coloured walls do the opposite. The illusion of space is defined by light reflected off the surfaces of the walls. Some types of lighting help with this illusion by further illuminating the walls. In addition, directional lighting, such as a track light can soften the wall colours. There is also recessed can lighting, which has a soft, downward glow that illuminates the floors and not walls. This is opposed to lights hung from the centre of the room, which provide ambient illumination, or wall lighting. In both cases, this can affect how light or dark a coloured section can appearThe lighting in a home changes the mood of a room just as it changes the perceived size of a room. \"Placement and type are important aspects of interior design and they work in conjunction with colour selections, room size, availability of natural light and furniture selection. The elements that come together when the right lighting is achieved transform a room into a seamless combination of functionality and style,\" says Radha Barua, an interior designer.The use of lighting can add to or subtract from the overall colours of a room. \"Darker colours make a room feel smaller and cramped, while light-coloured walls do the opposite. The illusion of space is defined by light reflected off of the surfaces of the walls. Some types of lighting help with this illusion by further illuminating the walls. In addition, directional lighting, such as a track light, can soften the wall colours. There is also recessed can lighting, which has a soft, downward glow that illuminates the floors and not walls. This is opposed to lights hung from the centre of the room, which provide ambient illumination, or wall lighting. In both cases, this can affect how light or dark a coloured section can appear,\" explains Radha. The lighting in a room either provides illumination for the entirety of the room, or it highlights very specific elements. \"Track lighting is the perfect example of positional lighting. Hung from the ceiling, the adjustable necks and lamps can be pointed at specific elements, such as a wall painting, the vase of flowers on an entryway table or the bar top or kitchen island. Consider mounting them on the walls also. Special picture and mirror frames also have built-in lighting to highlight specific areas on a wall,\" says Priya Agarwal, another interior designer. \"Recessed lighting can be used in floors and ceilings to create vertical beams of light as opposed to an overall glow from central light fixtures hanging from a ceiling,\" she adds. One major role of lighting in the interior setting is functionality. Lighting needs to serve a purpose, or it simply wastes electricity. \"Chandeliers are not only used in large, open foyers, entryways and rooms because of their centrally themed placement but also because they provide excellent illumination for the room. Wall lights add length and size, visually, to an entryway hall, as well as light the way. Consider the style of lighting you want to ensure you get the best directional or luminescent type for the setting. Look into task-specific lighting for desks and other work areas where functionality is more important than overall room illumination,\" says Priya. Moreover, both natural and man-made lighting helps with the illusion of space. For a darker room, find ways to bring in more full-spectrum natural light. If the room does not have sufficient lighting, it will feel cramped. \"This is worsened by close-proximity furniture arrangements, such as coffee table, end table, sofa, chair and love seat combinations in a smaller setting. Corner lamps, wall sconces and centrally hanging lights on the ceiling help brighten a room if natural lighting is not available and help create a visually larger space. This applies to any setting whether be it a home or office. Natural lighting is preferred above man-made lighting because it shows off colours better and adds to the visual space of a room by bouncing off reflective surfaces. Consider skylights or large windows if you want more natural light, or use sheer drapes and curtains to allow the maximum amount of light from your current windows,\" elaborates Radha.Also Read: Love and flower is a refugeeAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/get-the-right-light-and-set-your-mood-right/","tags":["Life,Saturday Fare,Supplements,More"],"title":"Get the Right Light and Set your Mood Right"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Lego is discontinuing its Mindstorms robotics kits by the end of the year Lego's Mindstorms robotics kits have been on the market since 1998, born from a collaboration between Lego and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Now, Lego has announced it will be discontinuing Mindstorms at the end of the year and providing support for the mobile app for at least another two years beyond that, Gizmodo has reported. Starting as the Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System over 24 years ago, the kits used Lego's advanced Technics pieces with gears and other robotics parts, powered by the basic \"Brick\" processing unit. They took a big step forward in 2006 with the introduction of the company's next generation of Mindstorms kits, dubbed NXT.Another big jump came in 2013 with the EV3 robotics platform. This new lineup was backwards-compatible with the NXT series, offering enhancements to its sensor load and processing power. Lego also launched dedicated mobile apps, turning iOS and Android devices into remote controls for Mindstorms projects. Finally, it set up a Mindstorms community where users could share their creations and collaborate with other builders.The last official product was the Robot Inventor lineup from 2020, but with nothing seen since, the writing seemed on the wall for Mindstorms — particularly as Lego was focusing on other educational ventures. \"Now having a number of priorities in LEGO Education and other Build \u0026 Code experiences, we have decided to focus our resources and future plans by redirecting our Mindstorms Robot Inventor team and their expertise into different areas of the business,\" the company said in a statement to Brick Fanatics. \"This means the physical Mindstorms Robot Inventor product (51515) and its related elements (88016 and 88018) are to exit our portfolio from the end of 2022, whilst digital platforms—such as the LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor App—will remain live until at least the end of 2024.\"It was one of the first toys to actively promote STEM learning while getting kids and adults alike interested in robotics. (Engadget collaborated with Lego on a Mindstorms robotics contest in 2014.) While it's the end of an era in robotics education, there are now plenty of kits on the market, including Lego's own Boost robotics kit for beginners. And if you happen to own a Mindstorms robot, it might soon become a collector's item. engadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/lego-is-discontinuing-its-mindstorms-robotics-kits-by-the-end-of-the-year/","tags":["Robots","Technology \u0026 Electronics","site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Steve Dent"],"title":"Lego is discontinuing its Mindstorms robotics kits by the end of the year"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Harish Kalyan ties the knot with Narmada Udaykumar.

I am a singer, songwriter and composer. As a songwriter I try to talk about the dark aspects of life which people generally don't talk about. I try to address anxiety, depression, social issues, individual and personal issues through my songs hoping that some people can connect to my messages and find hope. Everyone's life mattersNaaz Sultana an acclaimed singer of our state has been the flavour of local news after her debut performance (as an actor) in the recently released Assamese feature film Guwahati Diaries. \"I have composed, written and sung the song 'Mon boi jai' too for the movie and hence the movie is significant to me in more ways than one,\" she shares. Talking about the start of her professional journey, Naaz Sultana says, \"During my first year of graduation I started singing with a gospel band in a Christian NGO called 'Coffee House'. I founded the band White Beryl in the year 2009 along with my friend Vishal Chandra from Delhi .We were the only female fronted band selected for the Channel V launchpad prelims (in Delhi) in 2011. I was also the winner of Barista Acoustic Jam 2011 held in Delhi. In between I even did 'voice overs' for radio stations in Delhi and Guwahati. I eventually shifted to Guwahati in 2012 and since then have been performing here as a solo artist.\" Naaz Sultana is a self-taught musician. \"This journey of almost 17 years (until now) has been meaningful and beautiful. My music is experimental and I have no fixed genre. I perform western as well as Bollywood numbers. I improvise old Bollywood retro numbers with a western flavour and this style has received an overwhelming response from my audiences. They even termed it as my 'Signature style'. I dream to take Assamese rock to an international platform one day,\" she says. Naaz has performed for companies like Seagrams, United Spirits, Reliance, Honda, NRL,OIL India Limited, Larsen \u0026Turbo and many more. \"I have done festivals like Falcon Festival, Brahmaputra Film Festival, All India Art Festival, Metropolis and many more,\" she informs. Incidentally Naaz Sultana has performed at Rongali Festival 2019, which has been one of the biggest festivals of Assam. \"I was blessed to have shared the same stage with the stalwarts like Papon and Zublee. Moreover, she has also judged various singing competitions in the city. \"I have judged the Inter-school singing competition held by The National Public School, Guwahati consecutively for three years,\" she tells Saturday Fare. Talking about some highlights of her career, Naaz says, \"I released my fifth song 'Junaki Porua' in collaboration with the movie Fireflies- an Assamese feature film directed by Prakash Deka. Incidentally this is the first transgender movie of Assam. The lead actor bagged the best lead role in the South Asia film festival - Kashish, which is incidentally the fifth biggest queer film festival in the world.\" She continues, \"In the beginning of 2021 I released a rock song 'Aaina' that reiterates the importance of independent life choices (that are not influenced by a toxic society). Aaina is also one of the first Assamese rock songs to be featured in the online platform of 'Rolling Stones India', which is considered to be the biggest music magazine of India (and even across the world). In December 2021, I released my single 'Duur'. Rock Street Journal also known as RSJ, a renowned music journal of India featured and covered my work on 5th January this year.\" Talking about her childhood, family background and people who inspired and mentored her, Naaz shares, \" I was born in Bihpuria, Lakhimpur. Owing to my father's transferable job I spent my childhood days in a hostel. I was in class two when I first moved to hostel. So it won't be wrong if I say I actually grew up in Shillong. Later I shifted to Miles Bronson Residential and eventually to Jagiroad Kendriya Vidyalaya from where I gave my boards. Since I come from a middle class family I was told that scoring good grades and ultimately securing a government job should be my singular aim. However, when I pursued my graduation from Delhi University I realised that music was the purpose of my life. There was a Christian NGO near my PG. Every Thursday I would visit them and immensely enjoyed the gospels they sang. I started to be a regular and later joined them for the gospels. I sang and learnt a lot and started developing a deep connection with music.\" Naaz goes on to share that she saved money and bought a guitar. \"I started composing songs and learning guitar chords from the internet. In the meantime I had completed my graduation and was also practising and composing with my band 'White Beryl'. During this phase a serious family issue arose and I had to get a job to pay my bills. Actually I was pursing my CS too at that time but had to quit because of a pressing financial crisis. I started working for Jet Airways. It was a wonderful experience but somehow I was depressed as I was losing touch with music. My parents had separated and I had to support my mother. Eventually I decided to leave my job and come back home (to Guwahati) to support my mother and ofcourse pursue music too. I disappointed my family and relatives because they were against my decision to pursue music. My mother too was apprehensive as she thought music will not help me earn.\" However, as is obvious Naaz Sultana persisted against all odds. \"I believed strongly in myself and what I wanted to do. I wanted to live my passion. By God's grace over the years I have been doing my work and people have shown tremendous love and support towards my work. Therefore I feel very blessed. Today my mother is very proud of me.\" Naaz goes on to say that she lost her father this year; on 30th March 2022 to be precise. \"I miss him a lot. I loved my father a lot. I know that deep down even he accepted my love for music over the years when he was alive,\" she quietly adds. After a long pause, Naaz Sultana resumes, \"I have learnt that if you want something with all your heart, no one can stop you from having it. Your dedication and your determination matters the most. Also I never had any mentor. I mentored myself over the years. I never even had a chance to join music classes. The journey of my life has mentored me.\" Surely Naaz Sultana is an inspiration to many. So what or who inspires her? \"Sir Adil Hussain has been my biggest inspiration. When I performed for him he came up on the stage and recited a piece from the Othello as a token of appreciation for me which brought tears to my eyes. His humility has touched me,\" she states. Talking about her professional goals she concludes, \"My professional goal is to connect to people who would find solace in my work or some strength through my songs. I am a singer, songwriter and composer. As a songwriter I try to talk about the dark aspects of life which people generally don't talk about. I try to address anxiety, depression, social issues, individual and personal issues through my songs hoping that some people can connect to my messages and find hope. Everyone's life matters. I think music is my medium of expression through which I can try connecting to people in a better way. And in the next five years I want to see myself writing more and connecting more. I want to see myself travelling a lot too.

As such, there is a limit to how much law enforcement agencies in Singapore can do,” said Singapore’s minister for home affairs. Singapore Government’s Data on Cryptocurrency Scams The Singaporean government has revealed the number of reports related to cryptocurrency scams the police received in the past three years. In a written reply to a parliamentary question about crypto scams in Singapore, published last week, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law K. Shanmugam wrote: In 2019, the police received 125 reports related to cryptocurrency scams. This increased to 397 in 2020, and 631 in 2021. “The vast majority of cryptocurrency scams are perpetrated by scammers based outside Singapore. As such, there is a limit to how much law enforcement agencies in Singapore can do,” Minister Shanmugam added, elaborating: Our ability to solve these cases will depend on the level of cooperation from overseas law enforcement agencies, as well as their ability to track down these scammers. Nonetheless, we have stepped up our investigation efforts. The Singapore Police Force established a cryptocurrency taskforce in 2018 “to monitor the cryptocurrency landscape, develop and improve operational procedures in investigations and seizure of cryptocurrencies, and establish working relationships with overseas law enforcement agencies, industry professionals, and academic experts,” the minister noted. The taskforce works closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s central bank, which regulates entities that deal in or facilitate the exchange of cryptocurrencies. In conclusion, Minister Shanmugam stressed: The best defense, however, is a discerning public. To that end, we have stepped up public education efforts to educate the public on cryptocurrency-related scams. What do you think about the comments by Minister Shanmugam?

As a result, people are lining up outside stores to get the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, significantly as demand for the standard iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus has dropped dramatically compared to Apple's expectations. There have been reports online of Apple reducing the production capacity of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus to fit the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max.Now, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, has also spoken out on the issue of stock shortages. On the earnings call, Cook said that Apple is working very hard to meet the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max demand. Customer demand for the Pro variants is more vital than Apple had initially anticipated. As a result, production has been limited to the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max from the start.Demand for the iPhone 14 Pro exceeds Apple's expectationsCook said the restricted demand for the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max would be around for a while. Deliveries in the US from Apple's online store are said to be from November.On the other hand, reports have suggested that consumers need to take more interest in the standard iPhone 14 and the larger iPhone 14 Plus, both of which are slightly updated variants of last year's iPhone 13.Despite lower demand, Apple has reported a 10 per cent revenue increase this quarter. This could be primarily attributed to the Pro models selling in more significant numbers, which are priced much higher than the standard models this year. The Pro variants are the only ones getting the new 2022 upgrades, including Dynamic Island, the new 48MP primary camera, the A16 Bionic chip, and a 1Hz-120Hz variable refresh rate display. The A16 Bionic is based on the new 4nm chip, which promises a slight increase in overall performance.\nthehansindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-addresses-iphone-14-pro-supply-shortage/","tags":["Tech,Tech News"],"title":"Apple CEO Tim Cook addresses iPhone 14 Pro supply shortage"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"SJM writes to environment minister opposing the release of GM mustard Swadeshi Jagran Manch opposed regulatory body's recommendation for environmental release of genetically modified mustard, calling it \"dangerous\"\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/sjm-writes-to-environment-minister-opposing-the-release-of-gm-mustard/","tags":[],"title":"SJM writes to environment minister opposing the release of GM mustard"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Pro Kabaddi 2022: Tamil Thalaivas vs Jaipur Pink Panthers - Live streaming details, preview, head-to-head, squads, stats Pro Kabaddi 2022: Tamil Thalaivas takes on Jaipur Pink Panthers in the 1st match of October 28 on Friday.

With the Netherlands putting a lid on the scoring rate, India found it difficult to break free on a two-paced pitch. But Rohit (53 off 39 balls) and Kohli (62 not out off 44 balls) managed to share a 73-run stand for the second wicket. Suryakumar (51 not out off 25 balls) changed the tempo of the innings with his 360-degree style of batting and shared an amazing 95-run stand off 48 deliveries with Kohli for the third wicket as India posted a challenging 179/2 in 20 overs. In reply, the bowlers produced a top-class performance to restrict the Netherlands to 123/9 in 20 overs, as India's NRR jumped from +0.05 to +1.43. Electing to bat first, K.L Rahul was trapped lbw by a late inswinger from Paul van Meekeren though replays later showed the ball would have missed hitting leg-stump. With the Netherlands getting the ball to swing both ways, India struggled for fluency and timing. Though Rohit Sharma pulled van Meekeren for a six over deep square leg and nailed a square cut through off-side for four, he wasn't at his best. He had huge slices of luck on his side: a miscued pull off Klaassen in the fifth over was dropped by Tim Pringle at mid-on, and in the next over, his uppish flick off van Meekeren landed just in front of Pringle again at short fine leg. With Kohli struggling to find boundaries, Rohit cut loose by pulling Logan van Beek for a six over wide long-on. Luck again fell in his favour as he successfully survived an lbw appeal on the very next ball. From there, Rohit found his groove, uppishly cutting Bas de Leede through backward point for four, followed by a six through top-edge off the pull for successive boundaries. He then hit Pringle for back-to-back fours through leg-side to get his fifty in 35 balls. But in the next over, he was caught at deep mid-wicket off Klaassen while swiping across the line. Suryakumar's arrival opened the floodgates for India. He used the crease well and showed his impeccable wrist work to hit three fours in his first seven balls. He upped the ante by striking successive fours off de Leede in the 16th over. Kohli also joined the boundary party by heaving de Leede over short fine leg and then lofted Klaassen over mid-off for four more in the 17th over. He enthralled the crowd with a superbly timed loft over extra cover for six and bring up his second fifty on the trot in 37 balls. Suryakumar Yadav carved two delightful fours before ending the innings with a beautifully flicked six over deep backward square-leg off Logan van Beek and getting his fifty in 25 balls as India got 112 runs off the last ten overs. In reply, the Netherlands' chase never got going as Bhuvneshwar Kumar kept things tight in Power-play with successive maidens and clean-bowled a struggling Vikramjit Singh. Spinner Axar Patel (2-18) clean bowled the other Dutch opener Max O'Dowd for 16 with his second delivery, while Ravichandran Ashwin and Arshdeep Singh also pitched in with a couple of wickets each. Brief scores: India 179/2 in 20 overs (Virat Kohli 62 not out, Rohit Sharma 53; Paul van Meekeren 1/32, Fred Klaassen 1/33) beat Netherlands 123/9 in 20 overs (Tim Pringle 20, Colin Ackermann 17; Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2/9, Axar Patel 2/18) by 56 runs.

It's a medical thriller set majorly inside an Intense Care Unit of a hospital, with the textual and visual treatment of the story feeling more assembled than organic. The static camera movements, long and unedited shots, and dimly-lit sets mirror the gloom and despair of an ICU. The frames are as desolate as these long hospital hallways, with only the primary characters taking any space. The writing too feels lifeless, to begin with, almost as if it will be resuscitated eventually. With utmost confidence in the real-life subject the film handles, there is a visible effort from the makers to construct everything else as minimal as possible, to let the exploration into the setting be as measured as imaginable. However, in retrospect, this simplicity goes against everything the script tries to build, for it never seems to find a beat. Hence, both the textual and visual treatment of the film bears no fruit in a screenplay that cannot get more ordinary. However, being introduced to this world in such slow-burn treatment does excite. The very opening shot of the film is a slow zoom-in on a nurse named Charles Cullen (Eddie Redmayne). Charles is seen attending to an off-the-frame patient at the St. Aloysius Hospital in Pennsylvania when suddenly the alarms go blaring and the patient has a seizure. Instead of focusing on all the commotion and the doctors trying to fight the situation, the camera keeps getting closer and closer to Charles, with a background score that cannot get any eerier. We are then taken to 2003, six years after the incident, to Parkfield Memorial Hospital in New Jersey, where Amy Loughren (Jessica Chastain) is working as a nurse in the ICU. The way Amy is introduced fills the bleak, desaturated frames with hope. After attending to an elderly woman, she allows the husband to spend the night in the room, going against the hospital rules. But this isn't it. We immediately realise that Amy is suffering from a coronary illness called cardiomyopathy and that she has to hide this diagnosis from her employer for four more months to use the health insurance. The introduction of Amy, too, ends with a tight close-up shot, but for a different reason than that of Charles. It is safe to assume that he has an unhealthy obsession with the 'codes', or the alert sirens that ring out of the patients' monitoring system. When Amy fills the screen, we do feel the breathlessness, the break-neck lifestyle, and her dangerous duel with death. Soon we see Charles join Amy’s team at Parkfield, and the two share a cordial work relationship that is primarily built on how similar their respective marital situations are; both of them are separated, and are parents to two little girl children. But the similarities don’t stop there, as we soon realise. Both of them are hiding secrets. While we know what Amy is hiding, Charles’ case requires effort to unearth, and detectives Danny Baldwin (Nnamdi Asomugha) and Tim Braun (Noah Emmerich) are tasked with the same after a mysterious death of a patient at the ICU. But here's where the trouble begins for a thriller like The Good Nurse that is aimed to be simple and direct. The way the investigation progresses and drip-feeds the information — while building an intriguing psyche of the serial killer at hand — is all that matters. But here, the information is few and specific, and hence aids to not many surprises. It makes one wonder why the makers couldn't add at least one red herring for cinematic purposes. Further, we never truly get enough to understand the psyche of the serial killer. The only tension we feel is from a piece of information on how Charles once assaulted an ex-lover when they broke up. The duality of the two lead characters is the only noteworthy aspect of this screenplay. Charles and Amy are quite the opposites. The very title of the film is a play on them; on how Charles comes across as an innocent, meek, harmless nurse, and on the goodness in Amy's heart that drives her to do what is right despite it potentially endangering her life. Despite the anorexic characterisations, Jessica and Eddie shine at moments with restrained performances to keep you invested. But this is in a film that never clenches its fists, even in its attempt to make a social point about the effect of medical negligence, the importance of affordable health insurance, and the self-centred nature of businesses.

After their match against Zimbabwe was washed out, South Africa were looking to open their campaign with a big win. They did just that with a clinical display. Rossouw hammered 109 off 56 deliveries and raised 163 runs for the second wicket with opener Quinton de Kock (63) as South Africa reached 205/5 in their 20 overs. Nortje and Tabraiz Shamsi (3/20) then got into the act, sharing seven wickets between them as Bangladesh were shot out for 101 in 16.3 overs, slumping to a big defeat. Rilee Rossouw was in an aggressive mood against Bangladesh and his second T20I century helped South Africa post a big total despite losing skipper Temba Bavuma (2) with just seven runs on the board. While it was the biggest team total achieved so far at the T20 World Cup 2022, Rossouw's knock also broke a handful of individual records on a day where the left-hander was in scintillating touch. Rossouw became the first South African player to score a century at a T20 World Cup and his innings of 109 was the fifth largest in the history of the event. Rossouw was in devastating form as he hit seven fours and a whopping eight massive sixes and his 163-run partnership with Quinton de Kock was the catalyst for South Africa's huge score. De Kock's innings was slow and steady in comparison, but the South Africa opener looked in excellent touch too as he added 63 from just 38 deliveries to continue his fast start to the tournament. Speedster Anrich Nortje picked up two Bangladesh wickets in his first over and bowled with supreme pace to finish with career-best figures of 4/10. Spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (3/20) collected his three-wicket haul, while pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada (1/24) managed just one wicket from three decent overs. Rabada did play his part though with a superb piece of fielding late in proceedings as he threw down the stumps from close range to dismiss Hasan Mahmud. Brief scores: South Africa 205/5 off 20 overs (Quinton de Kock 63, Rilee Rossouw 109; Shakib Al Hasan 2/33) beat Bangladesh 101 all out in 16.3 overs (Litton Das 34, Soumya Sarkar 15; Anrich Nortje 4/10, Tabraiz Shamsi 3/20).

The deceased was identified as Jayanthi, who hailed from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, said the police. She was an assistant coach at Usha School, run by legendary athlete PT Usha, and had been working for one and a half years, police said. “The body was found at the hostel room when the trainees checked on her in the morning and we suspect suicide. Body has been sent to hospital for postmortem. We informed the woman’s family and her brother has reached from Tamil Nadu,” Perambra Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Vishnu Pratheep told indianexpress.com . The police said they were yet to find any suicide note. They collected Jayanthi’s phone and other personal belongings for forensic examination.

But it was all related to coaching only. She never discussed any personal matters to me. In fact, I found her very happy for the last two-three months. She was very happy saying her photo came in newspapers a few days ago. I don’t know what happened now. It was very shocking,” said Usha. Jayanthi was a state level athlete and a diploma holder from the National Institute of Sports in Patiala. The Usha School of Athletics was founded in 2002 and later shifted to Kinalur in 2008. Tintu Luka, the current 800m national record holder and Asian Games medalist, is the most famous athlete for the school.\nindianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/woman-trainer-found-dead-at-pt-ushas-athletics-school-in-suspected-su/","tags":["Sport Others","Sports"],"title":"Woman trainer found dead at PT Usha’s athletics school in ‘suspected suicide’"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"No social media for India pacer Bhuvneshwar during T20 World Cup No social media for India pacer Bhuvneshwar during T20 World Cup\n: Senior India pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar has revealed that he is staying off social media during the T20 World Cup 2022, adding it's helping him shut out the outside noise and focus on the job at hand. Bhuvneshwar has had a fine start to his World Cup campaign in Australia, having bowled as many as so far. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was under considerable pressure heading into the World Cup as he took on the onus of leading the Indian bowling attack in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah, who was ruled out due to an injury. Bhuvneshwar had been expensive at the death in the Asia Cup as he was taken to the cleaners by Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the Super 4 stages in the UAE in the 19th overs. Bhuvneshwar played against Australia at home and headed to the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru for rehabilitation as he missed the T20I series at home against South Africa. The break seemed to have helped Bhuvneshwar as the senior pacer has been able to deliver efficiently with the ball so far in Australia. \"During World Cup, I keep myself completely off from social media and have no idea what all is written about. Because it's the social media from which you come to know all these things,\" Bhuvneshwar told the media in Sydney, as quoted by PTI news agency. Speaking about his strong comeback, Bhuvneshwar said it's important to understand that ups and downs are part of the game and staying focused is key to finding success, especially in the T20 format which is tough on the bowlers. \"In all these years, I have had this one off tournament. It's happened. It's done and dusted,\" he added. \" The media and commentators can say a lot of things (about death bowling), but as a team, we knew that we will have our share of ups and downs. T20 is a format where it could be tough for bowlers and even for batters if the track is difficult one. But since Asia Cup is a big event people do tend to assess you that much more,\" he added. Bhuvneshwar said India's bowling unit has been trying to stick to the basics and not do anything extra to compensate for the absence of Bumrah. \"The kind of bowler Bumrah is, certainly its a big loss for the team. It's not as if we would have to do something extra that Bumrah isn't around,\" he added. \"Even if Bumrah would have been around, and if needed, we would have done those extra things. We are doing exactly what our strengths are.\" Heaping praise on Arshdeep Singh, Bhuvneshwar added: \"He has been amazing since his debut. He was always asking about what kind of track will there be on offer and what kind of shots the batters will play on this track. He asks me and also Rohit and Virat. Considering his first T20 World Cup, he is doing really well.\"\nindiatoday\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/no-social-media-for-india-pacer-bhuvneshwar-during-t20-world-cup/","tags":[],"title":"No social media for India pacer Bhuvneshwar during T20 World Cup"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Border Security Force (BSF) Recruitment 2022 - Assistant Commandant (Water Wing) Vacancy, Job Openings Border Security Force (BSF) is recruiting for Assistant Commandant (Water Wing) Vacancies, Apply Now.\nBorder Security Force (BSF) released the latest job notification for the recruitment of a Assistant Commandant (Water Wing) vacancy.

Keeping in this view, the KVK Tinsukia in collaboration with Tinsukia Municipal Board and district administration started collecting banana plants from garbage bins and roadsides after KVK provided the logistic support from Wednesday. The waste banana plants so collected will be utilized by KVK, Tinsukia for production of vermicompost and vermiwash in the demonstration-cum-production unit of KVK. The Senior Scientist \u0026 Head of KVK Tinsukia Gayatri Deori Bhuyan said the banana leaves after breakdown within the compost provide a nutrient rich additive for soil. Vermicomposting with equal amount of cow dung and leaf waste including dried ones showed best results in both quality and in vermicompost duration, she maintained adding that the solid wastes are successfully transformed into a nutrient rich vermicompost. She also said 'From 10 tonnes of plants we can produce 5 tonnes of vermicompost in around 2.5-3 months. Usually we have to purchase banana plants from outside to run our unit but this time both TMB and administration assisted the KVK in collection of raw material.\" Also Read: Participatory paddy crop cafeteria held at Krishi Vigyan Kendra, NagaonAlso watch:\nsentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/vermicompost-from-banana-leaves-in-krishi-vigyan-kendra-tinsukia/","tags":["NE News,Assam News"],"title":"Vermicompost from banana leaves in Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Tinsukia"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Kangana Ranaut hopes to regain access of her suspended Twitter account as Elon Musk takes control, fires top executives indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/kangana-ranaut-hopes-to-regain-access-of-her-suspended-twitter-account-as-e/","tags":["Bollywood","Entertainment"],"title":"Kangana Ranaut hopes to regain access of her suspended Twitter account as Elon Musk takes control, fires top executives"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Rajnath Singh on PoK and Gilgit-Baltistan thehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/rajnath-singh-on-pok-and-gilgit-baltistan/","tags":[],"title":"Rajnath Singh on PoK and Gilgit-Baltistan"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Bigg Boss 16: Salman Khan Schools Sumbul Touqeer For Weak Game Salman also refers to the time when Sumbul's father had asked her to play the game safely and wisely on the show\nndtv\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/bigg-boss-16-salman-khan-schools-sumbul-touqeer-for-weak-game/","tags":["Television"],"title":"Bigg Boss 16: Salman Khan Schools Sumbul Touqeer For Weak Game"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Garena Free Fire Max Redeem Codes for October 28, 2022: Grab your daily rewards and goodies here Players can choose their starting positions in this game, as well as collect supplies and weaponry to keep them going while on the battlefield.

Ram Setu has still managed to stay decent in theatres and has managed the kind of footfalls from where it can hope to grow again over the weekend. However, Thank God has surprisingly seen relatively bigger drops since its release and would need a push over the next few days in order to survive. Let's talk about Ram Setu first. After taking an opening of Rs. 15.25 crores, it has come to Rs. 8.75 crores on the third day. Ideally, the numbers should have been in double digits even on Thursday but though that hasn't happened, there are hopes that collections would be on an upswing all over again on Saturday and Sunday. Prior to that it has to be seen whether Friday collections are closer to that of Thursday and if even if there is a drop then it's not more than 10%-15%. That would signify stability at the box office and then further growth. On the other hand, Thank God had started at Rs. 8.10 crores and has come to almost half of that on the third day with Rs. 4.15 crores coming in. Again, the collections should have been on the upwards of Rs. 5 crores on Thursday but with that not happening, one now waits to see how things turn out to be today. The film cannot afford to fall any further though the trend so far indicates that the film will indeed go below the Rs. 4 crores mark. From here, it would indeed be an uphill task for the film to score and it's all about how much best it would score by close of Sunday. So far, Ram Setu has collected Rs. 35.40 crores at the box office and the aim would be go past the Rs. 60 crores mark before Sunday closes. That should happen eventually. On the other hand, Thank God would go past Rs. 30 crores for sure but in order to have a lifetime of over Rs. 50 crores, it needs to be closer to Rs. 35 crores by the time Sunday is through.

Basavalinga Sree was honey trapped systematically and evidence collected against him by a group of influential people. Devotees are claiming that the video clip is not recorded on the mutt premises. They claim that the deceased seer used to wear gold karadige (shivling covered in a tiny box and worn around the neck) which is missing and that he wore rudraksha mala only when he went out. Three women are being questioned with regard to honey-trapping the swamiji. The police are verifying whether that voice in the video clip resembles any of the three women. Earlier, the investigations into the suicide case had revealed that the deceased seer was honey-trapped, tortured and forced to end life. The investigations have also suggested that there is the hand of another Lingayat seer, who is eyeing on the position behind this conspiracy. Police explained that a team of 10 to 15 persons, including politicians, worked and executed the plan. The deceased seer was systematically honey-trapped and blackmailed over release of photos and videos of his private moments, police said. The Kudur police, who have taken up the investigation of the case, have already taken a few persons into custody and are investigating the matter.

According to Reuters, Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and policy chief Vijaya Gadde were all escorted out by security as Musk took control.The Twitter takeover comes after Musk and Twitter had been locked in a ten-month long legal battle after he got cold feet about going through with the deal. In this saga, which many have dubbed as Musk’s biggest publicity stunt, the billionaire has accused the social media giant of misleading him and other investors over fake accounts or spam accounts. When Agrawal responded to his claims, Musk responded with, unbelievably, with a poop emoji.At one point during Musk’s attempt to take over, he also said that Twitter was dying, prompting a stern reaction from Agrawal, and describing his comments as unhelpful and an “internal distraction”.But, the Twitter episode isn’t the only time that his eccentric ways have come to the fore and shown that he doesn’t necessarily have the greatest business acumen.Outside of his many contentious statements on Twitter and his remarkably controversial personal life, he has to his credit some of the wildest and most eye-rolling publicity stunts in recent memory.Fiery flamethrowersIn early January 2018, one of Elon Musk’s many companies, The Boring Company, announced the launch of Not-A-Flamethrower (the product’s official name), which, ironically was a flamethrower.At the time, he had tweeted, “When the zombie apocalypse happens, you’ll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!\"He had also posted a video to his Instagram (now deleted) where he was seen wielding one of the devices and charging toward the person filming him.Unsurprisingly, the sale of flamethrowers was not without controversy.Musk insisted that “obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea” warning people to “definitely don’t buy one … unless you like fun”. He said that the flamethrower did not shoot flames further than 10ft so it was “A-OK”.By February, Musk announced that all 20,000 flamethrowers had sold out at $500 a piece, amassing $10 million.Tesla Tequila!Think of this scenario. You are doing marketing for a new car and want a crossover product and narrow it down to alcohol.That’s what happened with Elon Musk, who initially suggested Tesla Tequila as an April Fools’ joke.On April Fools’ Day in 2018, the American entrepreneur joked that Tesla had gone “completely and totally bankrupt”, leading to him being “found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by ‘Teslaquilla’ bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks.”Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by \"Teslaquilla\" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks.This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point?Happy New Month! pic.twitter.com/YcouvFz6Y1— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 1, 2018Six months later, Musk filed an application with the US Patent and Trademark Office to trademark ‘Teslaquila’ and teased a visual of the bottle on Twitter.Two years later, the drink was launched at a cost of $250. Contained inside a glass bottle shaped like a lightning bolt, which could be a reference to the company's electric cars, the product is only available in select states in the US.Tesla in spaceIn 2018, Musk did something bonkers and completely out of this world! He launched Starman — an astronaut-like dummy — into orbit on a Tesla Roadster (his own personal car) attached to SpaceX's Heavy Falcon rocket.Goodbye, Earth! pic.twitter.com/8PZh7SNyUH— Starman (@SpaceX_Starman) February 7, 2018The move was titled by many advertising and marketing gurus as one of the greatest marketing stunts ever.The launch live stream reached over 2.3 million concurrent viewers on YouTube, which made it the second most watched live event on the platform, behind another space-related event: Felix Baumgartner's jump from the stratosphere in 2012.Two years later in October, it was reported that Starman had cruised by Mars for the first time.Challenging Putin to combatOf all the things Musk has ever done, this might be the craziest yet.The billionaire baffled the internet recently after challenging Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin to “single combat”, with the country of Ukraine as the stakes.I hereby challenge Владимир Путин to single combatStakes are Україна— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 14, 2022“Do you accept this fight?” he added in Russian, directly addressing the official English-language Twitter account of the 69-year-old president.Talk about publicity: the tweet till date has seen 53,600 retweets and 3.9 lakh likes on the social media website.A pig called GertrudeOne of his other publicity stunts was when he unveiled a pig called Gertrude with a coin-sized computer chip in her brain to demonstrate his ambitious plans to create a working brain-to-machine interface in 2020.His company Neuralink’s ambition is to develop mass-market brain-computer interfaces that allow you to control things with your mind, as well as to cure depression, spinal injuries and neurological disorders.What happened to the pig after that no one knows, and no one knows where Musk has reached on the tech to create the interface.His children’s namesWhen people have children, they come up with names like Sally or John or Peter. However, when Musk had a baby in May 2020 with his indie-pop star partner Grimes, they called the infant X Æ A-12 Musk, which was off even for their standards.The pair then announced they had a second child, too, with a similarly strange name — Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, Y for short.With inputs from agenciesRead all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

Email Jonathan or tweet @JPHowcroftMelbourne, like all of Australia’s east coast, has been saturated this spring, and today has been no exception.

We need to come out with a really attacking mindset and maybe throw caution to the wind and see how we go.” I like England’s bullishness in white ball cricket. I just wonder if this particular group has the confidence of recent iterations to back it up, especially without Eoin Morgan calling the shots. They could definitely do with Jos Buttler and Alex Hales both going full Finn Allen off the top, especially if it’s a five-over slog. Matthew Mott wants England to have attacking mindset against Australia Read more 4m ago 08.53 BST Matt Hobbs has emailed a terrific question: ”Such a shame about the weather but a genuine question: would England prefer one point or the lottery of a five-over game? Their net run rate is currently better than Australia’s although the Aussies have two easier (at least on paper) fixtures to come. I’m not sure England would hate a draw and living to fight another day.” I don’t think anybody ever wants a washout, do they? But I reckon England would be the happier of the two teams if the points are shared because Australia are the side that needs to make up ground. England lead Australia on net run rate 0.239 to -1.555, so a point apiece keeps their noses in front. But like you say, England’s remaining fixtures – New Zealand and Sri Lanka – are tougher on paper than Australia’s – Ireland and Afghanistan – so this could be a chance of making a decisive move up the table. 13m ago 08.45 BST Here in Australia, Channel Nine’s live coverage has been very clunky, and they’ve just filled some time celebrating Matthew Wade’s courage for preparing to play tonight despite being diagnosed with Covid yesterday. Including making a joke about England’s players staying one and a half metres away from him. Instead of, you know, asking why on earth in the middle of a pandemic and on the cusp of a new wave in Australia everybody isn’t taking the kind of precautions we took for granted up until a few months ago. Under tournament rules Wade is allowed to play (if he feels up to it) but he has to make his own way to the ground and change in separate facilities. Teammate Adam Zampa also tested positive ahead of the Afghanistan match, but swapping him out for Ashton Agar was straightforward. Wade is trickier because Australia do not have another wicketkeeper in their squad. Josh Inglis was originally named but after he got injured he was replaced by Cameron Green, not another gloveman. Recently diagnosed with Covid, Matthew Wade and Adam Zampa survey the MCG. Photograph: Quinn Rooney/Getty Images 20m ago 08.37 BST Cut off time is 9:46pm in Melbourne.

What has made today exceptional is quite how spitefully the rain has been delivered, blowing in horizontally in unpredictable gusts, at a frigid temperature. The ‘feels like’ widget of the forecast dashboard hasn’t reached double figures all day. It is grim. Ireland vs Afghanistan has already been washed out without a ball being bowled. The MCG is grey and sodden. We are very unlikely to start on time. More promisingly, the raincloud the size of Wales that has sat over the state of Victoria for most of the day is moving its way eastwards, and should soon clear Melbourne CBD, aside for some tendril-like showers. These modern grounds drain quickly and umpires have already shown their eagerness to play through tricky conditions this tournament, so we may yet have a match, however short. For that to occur play needs to be underway by 10.04pm (12.04pm BST). A disappointed Barry McCarthy rues Ireland’s inability to take on Afghanistan at a rain-soaked MCG. Photograph: Martin Keep/AFP/Getty Images 1h ago 08.00 BST Preamble Jonathan Howcroft Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of the 2022 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup . Weather permitting, Australia vs England in Group 1 of the Super 12s begins at the Melbourne Cricket Ground at 7pm local time (9am BST). If the rain does hold off, this is a fixture of enormous consequence to the tournament. After Australia were bullied by New Zealand and England outplayed by Ireland , defeat tonight probably spells the end of the loser’s campaign. Australia rebounded with a Marcus Stoinis-inspired settler against Sri Lanka, but the defending champions haven’t clicked yet, extending a prolonged run of indifferent performances in the format. Of greatest concern is the output of skipper Aaron Finch at the top of the order. Finch has already announced his retirement from the ODI format and is limping towards the end of his T20i career on home soil. England are back in action just two days after they failed to adapt to the characterful MCG surface against Ireland. The seam bowlers were too short and the batters never looked assured on a deck that offered plenty of movement and bounce. Against the highest quality pace attack in world cricket England’s top order need to find both intent and timing. I’ll be back shortly with the toss and the teams synonyms for rain. In the meantime, you can contribute by sending me an email or directing any tweets to @JPHowcroft . A sodden MCG is wet, muddy, and miserable ahead of Australia and England’s clash.

With the management expecting funding costs to grow another 40 to 50 basis points sequentially, net interest margins are likely to stay under pressure going forward. SBI Card reported net profit of Rs 526 crore in the June-September quarter, a 28% rise year-on-year. However, profits dipped sequentially due to higher operating spends, lower margins and a decline in share of revolvers in the overall customer pile. With the management expecting the share of revolvers to return to normalcy going forward, SBI Card could see an improvement in its profitability but cost of funds and regulations governing transaction fees would be key factors to watch out for going forward, analysts said. SBI Card also saw a modest improvement in asset quality over the quarter with gross non-performing assets falling 10 basis points over the previous quarter to 2.14% of gross advances. Shares of SBI Card fell 5.23% to Rs 813.30 apiece as of 9:40 a.m. while the benchmark Nifty 50 gained 0.35% on the NSE.Here's what analysts expect from SBI Cards going forward:Morgan StanleyCost of funds is likely to keep moving up but yields could improve as transactor mix normalises.Due to accelerated card acquisition, operating costs could remain elevated in the near-term.Sustained earnings recovery could spark investor interest.Management expects to increase share of corporate spends to 25% but in a calibrated manner.Maintain a 'overweight' rating with a price target of Rs 1,100 apiece.Motilal OswalExpect revolver mix to increase gradually as spends mature and festive season progresses.Growth in spends likely to stay healthy.Increase in share of interest-earning assets is likely to increase, offsetting cost-of-funds pressure on the margins.Maintain a 'buy' rating with a target price of Rs 1,000 apiece.Axis CapitalGrowth signals such as increase in spends, new launches, and stable asset quality remain strong.Management in on track to achieve 30 lakh net card additions per month.Uptick in share of EMIs as part of overall receivable likely to continue over the third quarter.Slower growth in net interest margins and share of revolvers need to be watched.Revise target price to Rs 980 as opposed to Rs 1,040 earlier.Continue Reading.

The lawsuits accuse the company of designating its \"personal shoppers\" (who pick and deliver grocery orders) as independent contractors to avoid paying benefits like state unemployment insurance and worker's compensation. \"Increasingly, we’re seeing companies abuse hard-working District residents by fraudulently calling them independent contractors and, as a result, denying them wages and benefits they are legally owed,\" said DC AG Karl Racine in a statement.Shipt said it disagrees with the allegation and that most of its workers prefer being able to set their own hours. \"Shoppers with Shipt are independent contractors, and the flexibility that comes with being an independent contractor is the primary reason Shipt Shoppers choose to earn on our platform,\" spokesperson Evangeline George told CBS News. Citing its own survey, it said that 80 percent of its workers named such flexibility as a key priority.However, Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison said the company controls \"virtually every facet of a shopper's work\" despite claiming the workers are independent. \"Unlike other employees, these workers have no clarity on how much they will be paid day to day, and they often don't receive the minimum wage and overtime they're entitled to,\" he added. The suits seek to recover paid sick leave owed, unpaid wages, payments owed for unemployment insurance, penalties and more. Other delivery companies including DoorDash have faced similar actions, and Instacart recently agreed to pay $46.5 million in a settlement with the city of San Diego over misclassified workers.

How did BJP get this money? What is ED \u0026 IT doing now?\" Congress leader BK Hariprasad said. However, Union Minister for Tourism and Culture G. Kishan Reddy on Thursday alleged that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) scripted the poaching drama to malign the BJP, and demanded that the police reveal details like the amount of cash seized from three persons arrested in the case. Dismissing the allegations that the BJP tried to lure four TRS MLAs with huge sums of money, important positions and contracts, he said the BJP would have gained nothing by making four MLAs defect to the party. He wondered why the police were not revealing how much money was seized and where it came from. Addressing a press conference, the minister denied any links with the accused in the case. The Cyberabad police on Wednesday arrested three persons from a farmhouse at Moinabad near Hyderabad when they were allegedly trying to lure four TRS MLAs to the BJP. On a complaint by one of the MLAs, Pilot Rohit Reddy, police registered a case against Ramachandra Bharati alias Satish Sharma of Delhi, Nanda Kumar of Hyderabad and Simhayaji Swamy of Tirupati. The TRS leaders have alleged that Nanda Kumar is close to Kishan Reddy.

This day marked the day of the renaissance of India's education system when the Madhya Pradesh government launched medical education in Hindi, thereby writing the first chapter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts towards education in native languages.Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had said, 'Indian culture is like a fully bloomed lotus, each petal of which is like our regional languages. Destroying any one petal will destroy the beauty of the lotus. I want regional languages to remain the queens of states and Hindi should be at the centre'. In these words, Gurudev beautifully described the richness of India's cultural and linguistic diversity. Similarly, Bhartendu Harichandji's description of `Nij Bhasha', is all-inclusive in its connotation, encompassing all Indian languages from the south to north and from the east to west as our own. Languages are deeply embedded, culturally and historically, in the essence of India and Indianness. It is the language that connects an individual with the essential spirit and being of the nation and its culture. It is in this context that we need to understand, without any prejudice, that Hindi is not in conflict with any other Indian language. Sometimes a misconception that Hindi runs counter to other Indian languages is spread. Nothing can be further from the truth. Hindi is India's Rajbhasha and has no inherent conflict with any other Indian language. Hindi is a friend and comrade of all Indian languages. However, in my view, Hindi and all other Indian languages need to be a little flexible. The flexibility will help address differences among languages, if any, with a spirit of accommodation and assimilation. This will further enable languages to flourish and expand in a cohesive sense of progressive culture-linguistic companionship. Some people attach a sense of superiority to those who are accomplished in the English language. The truth is that language has nothing to do with an individual's wisdom or intellectual capabilities. Language is only a medium of articulation and expression. In fact, a person's intellectual capability has a better chance of sparkling brighter if education is imparted in one's native language. The education imparted in a language other than the native language can limit the intellectual progress of a child because thinking abilities are the most compelling in his or her own native language. Therefore, in my view, there is a deep connection between the educational progress of a child and the medium of instruction. Due to the lack of options to study in native languages, we have so far been able to exploit not more than 5 per cent of our nation's potential in research, science, humanities and other academic fields. Therefore, India's goal for Atmanirbharta will receive a big push when education is imparted in native languages enabling us to take full advantage of our intellectual capabilities. That is the reason why educationists across the world are increasingly giving greater primacy to native languages as the main medium of teaching that emboldens people's intellectual thinking, research, and analytical abilities. The father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi always favoured making technical and specialised knowledge more accessible to India's masses by connecting these with Indian languages. Gandhi Ji said, \"We should have an army of chemists, engineers and other experts who will be real servants of the nation…all these experts will speak, not a foreign tongue, but the language of the people. The knowledge gained by them will be the common property of the people.\" Following Gandhi Ji's thoughts, the Narendra Modi government, under the New Education Policy, is working towards imparting education in native languages—from primary to technical, to engineering to law and medical education. The government is unwavering in its focus on this. Under this, Madhya Pradesh has become the first state to introduce MBBS courses in Hindi. India is firmly marching on the path of Atmanirbharta as envisioned by Prime Minister Modi. It is important to keep in mind that Atmanirbharta is not just about business, commerce, and services but also about our languages. It is vital to make our languages strong to achieve the goal of Atmanirbharta. Due to this, the new Education Policy has laid emphasis on imparting education in native languages. As a result, Indian languages are being accorded the deserved importance in the country's education system. Initiatives have been taken to impart engineering education in eight Indian languages—Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Hindi and Assamese—by translating books into these languages. Examinations under NEET and UGC are now also being conducted in 12 languages. All these exemplify the Modi government's efforts and initiatives to strengthen Indian languages. In the 19th century, Dadbhai Naoroji described the repatriation of resources from India as a \"drain of wealth\". Today, there is a \"drain of the brain\" that we are witnessing in the 21st century. The same forces that oversaw the \"drain of wealth\" are now involved in the \"brain drain\" from India by inducing India's youth through education in foreign languages. This situation of \"brain drain\" will turn into a position of \"brain gain\" when India's youth start receiving education in their native languages. Today, measures are being taken to impart education in Indian languages that will prevent India's youth from getting subjugated by foreign languages and cultures. Instead, they will be empowered to think and stoke their intellectual curiosity in their native languages. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), whenever presented with an opportunity, has always worked towards strengthening and emboldening Indian languages. Even after the era of colonisation ended, successive governments in India, for long periods, subjected Indian languages to a sense of inferiority. While most leaders from India used to speak in English on overseas and multilateral platforms, Atal Behari Vajpayee, as the country's foreign minister, spoke in Hindi at the United Nations, marking an occasion of great honour for Indian languages. Today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also speaks in Hindi in overseas forums, carrying forward the legacy of Mr Vajpayee. Modi Ji's speeches in Hindi have not only served to establish the honoured identity of Indian languages but also raised the self-confidence of Indians. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's focus on imparting education in native languages will not only bolster Indian languages but also qualitatively raise the intellectual capabilities of our students. I am fully confident that for generations to come Indian languages will thrive and evolve with a strong fabric of public interest and development in a continuum of progressive adaptability.\nsentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/education-in-native-languages-will-boost-atmnirbharta/","tags":["Editorial,More"],"title":"Education in native languages will boost Atmnirbharta"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Commonwealth Secy Gen welcomes India’s offer to share UPI technology with member countries Payment through UPI crossed a milestone of ₹11 lakh crore in September, as per the data released by the National Payments Corporation of India\nthehindubusinessline\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/commonwealth-secy-gen-welcomes-indias-offer-to-share-upi-technology-with/","tags":[],"title":"Commonwealth Secy Gen welcomes India’s offer to share UPI technology with member countries"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Ram Setu Box Office: क्या अक्षय की फिल्म का फीका पड़ रहा है जादू? जानें, तीसरे दिन कैसा रहा फिल्म का रिस्पॉन्स Ram Setu Box Office Collection: बॉलीवुड एक्टर अक्षय कुमार इन दिनों अपनी फिल्म 'राम सेतु' को लेकर जबरदस्त चर्चा में बने हुए हैं। काफी समय बाद अक्षय की किसी फिल्म को दर्शकों का इतना अच्छा रिस्पॉन्स भी मिला है। दिवाली की\nhindioneindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/ram-setu-box-office-/","tags":[],"title":"Ram Setu Box Office: क्या अक्षय की फिल्म का फीका पड़ रहा है जादू? जानें, तीसरे दिन कैसा रहा फिल्म का रिस्पॉन्स"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Bigg Boss 16: Twitterati is disappointed with Gautam Vij, points out the one-sided friendship of Nimrat and Shalin for him!

Mazzant […]\nA district judge has ordered a bitcoin Ponzi operator to be arrested and imprisoned after he ignored multiple court orders and failed to pay the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) $40 million. He pleaded guilty to securities fraud in 2015. Bitcoin Ponzi Operator Faces Imprisonment After Failing to Pay SEC Judge Amos L. Mazzant of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas said earlier this week that a bitcoin Ponzi operator will be arrested and imprisoned for civil contempt unless he immediately provides overdue documents and payments, Bloomberg reported. Trendon Shavers, a resident of McKinney, Texas, owes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) more than $40 million after pleading guilty in September 2015 to one count of securities fraud. However, he has repeatedly disregarded court orders, Judge Mazzant said, adding: Shavers’s flagrant disregard for the court’s orders on multiple occasions leads to only one conclusion: Shavers will only comply with the court’s orders if he is incarcerated. The SEC charged Shavers and his company, Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST), in July 2013 for running a bitcoin Ponzi scheme. According to the authorities, he defrauded investors out of at least 764,000 BTC. The SEC obtained a ruling against him in September 2014. The regulator said at the time: The court’s judgment requires Shavers and BTCST to pay more than $40 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and orders each defendant to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. Judge Mazzant’s contempt order focuses on the SEC’s effort to enforce the $40.4 million civil judgment, the publication conveyed. The SEC asked Shavers for certain financial documents to determine his ability to pay the disgorgement. Shavers testified that he had made no payments and that he was earning about $4,000 per month. The court ordered him to produce the documents and make six $400 payments but the documents and two of the payments never materialized, which led to more SEC motions and court orders. The district judge also noted that Shavers failed to appear for a hearing. He reiterated that other than imprisonment, he saw “no other way to coerce Shavers to comply” with court orders. Do you think Shavers should go to prison for not paying the SEC after pleading guilty?

The United Nations declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millet brings a great opportunity for Assam to popularize the Assam Millet Mission for boosting its production. India as the largest producer of millets pushed the UN General Assembly resolution to raise awareness and policy action for the nutritional and health benefits of millets consumption and their suitability for sustainable cultivation under adverse climatic conditions. This puts millet production in the state in the global context and brings an added advantage for popularizing millet production and consumption. Assam government's decision to set up the Assam Millet Mission for seven years starting from the current financial year has led to the establishment of millet demonstration farms in 15 districts. According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, millets are among the first plants to be domesticated and are considered Nutri-cereals due to their high nutritional content. While millets are easy to grow, favourable climatic conditions and the traditional expertise of farmers make it an ideal place to promote pre-historic crops. Evaluation carried out by the Regional Agricultural Research Station at Gossaigaon of small millet breeding materials provided to farmers under the All India Coordinated Research Project on small millets of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and Indian Institute of Millet Research, found that there was an increase in grain yield with 33.87 per cent following the demonstration with improved practices in finger millet. The Gossaigaon station, one of the six RARS of Assam Agricultural University, has been popularizing millets cultivation among the farming community of the Lower Brahmaputra Valley Zone through demonstration of local varieties of finger millet, locally known as Maruadhan and foxtail millet, locally known as Konidhan, according to NEH Annual Progress Report: AICRP Small Millets Kharif 2020-21. \"The Lower Brahmaputra Valley Zone of Assam has been facing the ramification of chronic problems of low crop productivity, food and nutritional insecurity, population explosion, poverty and resource shrinkage and degradation. Being the largest zone of the state, it enshrines a wide array of agro-ecological situations, socio-economic conditions, ethnicity, flood and drought proneness, soil conditions and microclimate variations,\" states the report which also explains the importance of the 15 millet demonstration farms set up under the millet mission in the state in promoting millets for food security. Traditionally, finger millets are grown in the Kharif season and the foxtail millet in the Rabi season. For the first two years, the mission activities will be fully funded under the World Bank-financed Assam Agribusiness and Rural Transformation Project (APART) and in the third year, the activities will be partly funded by APART and partly by the State government and Central government schemes while from the fourth year onwards, the funds will be sourced from State and Central government schemes. The farmers undertaking millet cultivation under the mission of attaining self-sufficiency through smooth market linkage and assured remunerative price within the project period will be crucial for the sustainability of millet cultivation in the state. The Assam Cabinet deciding to introduce millets under the Mid Day Meal scheme (now renamed as PM-POSHAN) under the Sarba Siksha Abhiyan Mission for and supplying millet-based products to districts with Integrated Child Development Centres improving nutritional standards of children will generate demand for locally produced millets and assured markets of government procurement. The Central Government has revised the guidelines for the movement of the surplus production of millets to other States and the provision of inter-state transportation of surplus millets through the Food Corporation of India (FCI) is incorporated to cater for advance demand placed by consuming states before the start of procurement. Lessons must be learnt from poor procurement of rice in the state by FCI and the State government pushing for policies that ensure that millet growers in the state are not adversely affected by any procurement and distribution of surplus millet production of other states under any flagship programme of the Central government for PM-POSHAN. Such policies must ensure that millet grown by Assam farmers is first procured for any state or central schemes involving millet supplies for a nutritional supplement of children or other age groups and if there is any shortfall it is met by supplies from a central pool of FCI procurement from other states. State Government procuring millets at a Minimum Support Price will be crucial to motivate the farmers by assuring them of livelihood protection after shifting from paddy to millet. The production of millets in India has increased from 17.26 million tonnes during 2019-20 to 18.02 million tonnes in 2020-21 while it has gone up from 1.31 lakh tonnes to 1.51 lakh tonnes in Assam which indicates a gradual rise in popularity among farmers. The Assam Millet Mission has brought new hopes for remunerative and sustainable millet farming.\nsentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/the-large-mission-of-small-millets-in-assam/","tags":["Editorial,More"],"title":"The large mission of small millets in Assam"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"YouTube introduces @ Handle feature: Know what is it, how it works and more YouTube says its Handle feature would enable new way for users to find and connect with creators\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/youtube-introduces-handle-feature-know-what-is-it-how-it-works-and-more/","tags":[],"title":"YouTube introduces @ Handle feature: Know what is it, how it works and more"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Gold rates today in Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai - 28 October 2022 Gold rates today, 28 October 2022: Gold rates in Delhi per 10 grams of 22 carats is at Rs. 47,250 and the rate of 10 grams of 24 carats is at Rs. 51,530\nGold rates today in Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, MumbaiGold rates today in Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, MumbaiGold rates today, 28 October 2022: Gold rates today at Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Mumbai stable.

I am talking […] The post Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro review: Best earbuds for Samsung users appeared first on BGR India.\nEvery smartphone brand is trying to do what Apple did years ago and proudly continues to do: create a mobile ecosystem in the most convenient way that compels the user not to leave it. An ecosystem includes the phone and everything that it can power to give you the ultimate gadget experience. I am talking about wearables and truly wireless earbuds are a crucial part of them. Apple’s AirPods do not work on any phone other than an iPhone (or other Apple products). For years, Samsung, which uses the open ecosystem of Android, has been trying to do that. With the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, it seems to have finally landed its dream. The new and not-shiny Galaxy Buds 2 Pro borrows a lot from its prequel, but these earbuds do not work on all phones similarly. Samsung has locked certain features of the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro for its phones. So unless you use the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro with a Samsung phone, you cannot experience features such as 24-bit lossless music or spatial audio. In essence, these are incentives that a brand gives you to stay inside its ecosystem. Apple does that on a stricter level, while Google, too, has built a robust ecosystem for its Pixel-branded products. Singling out Samsung isn’t fair, but, at the price of Rs 17,999, do the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro make sense for you? That depends. I have been using the new Galaxy Buds 2 Pro for a while, and I can say they are among the best wireless earbuds money can buy. Here is my review. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro design The new Galaxy Buds 2 Pro looks a bit twee, which is a good thing because other earbuds look more or less the same. Samsung has continued with the in-ear design that lacks the stem, so it may not suit everyone. For me, it is irrelevant as long as the fit is comfortable — something I experience with the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. Not only the earbuds are lightweight, but they also snug well inside ears and do not fall unless triggered by your facial movements. The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro is smaller than the original Galaxy Buds Pro and comes with a soft fabric-like matte finish, which makes it less prone to scratches and dirt, and gives it a better grip. The overall design of the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro makes for a comfortable fit. I never felt discomfort wearing the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro and the earbuds stayed intact unless I laughed. And yes, there is a USB-C port on the side. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro in Bora Purple colour (Image: Shubham Verma) Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro sound Previous Galaxy Buds Pro models have offered great audio listening experience, so my expectations from the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro were based accordingly. I was not disappointed. Within the first few minutes of my usage, I realised the Buds 2 Pro can easily take on the AirPods and Sony WF-1000XM4. The sound is not only clear but there is also a wide soundstage that makes the entire listening experience better. That helps when you have music coming from several instruments. And that is why I played some Indian Cinema music to test out if the bass, treble, and vocals were on point. Oo Anatava from the movie Pushpa played out nicely, leaving enough room for every instrument to be perfectly heard. Of course, the song is bass-heavy and likeable in that form. The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro takes care of that, giving an enjoyable experience. Shringaar by Aastha Gill and Akasa is a fusion of both Indian Classical and hip-hop, which the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro did justice to. The warmth of tabla and dholak was on point, while the electronic music-inspired hip-hop beats made me groove. I am also a fan of retro music, which lacks bass and modern music composition. So, when I played Ye Shaam Mastani, I went into a zone of tranquillity. Adele’s Oh My God had a good funk to it while making sure the vocals do not get meddled with by the sound of instruments. Midnights by Taylor Swift was another album I loved listening to on the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, primarily because it can pick up soft tones and render them beautifully. Some of the credit for this enjoyable listening experience goes to noise isolation, but if you have turned on noise cancellation, you can recognise the instruments and their contribution to the melody you are listening to. Not that it is outstanding, but it is nice to see Samsung paying attention to detail when it comes to earbuds. The stemless earbuds of the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro (Image: Shubham Verma) Sure, the music on the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro is good, but what about that 24-bit hi-fi sound? Samsung claims the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro can play hi-fi music when paired with a Samsung phone running One UI 4.0 or later. That is a lot of phones, so even if you have a cheaper Galaxy A or Galaxy F series phone, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro will work as intended. Samsung says its new Seamless codec allows Galaxy Buds 2 Pro to stream 24-bit, 48kHz audio, but it does not tell the bitrate. According to The Verge citing a Samsung spokesperson, the hi-fi audio quality offers a bitrate of 2304kbps. I honestly couldn’t verify it, but I would agree that listening to music in the lossless quality on Apple Music on a Samsung phone using the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro was slightly better than what I have heard otherwise. If you are using a Samsung phone, you can also experience spatial audio on the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. It is essentially the movement of audio according to the movement of your head. I don’t think it is a revolutionary thing for the music tech, but it’s good to have on devices outside of the Apple ecosystem. Both the hi-fi audio quality and spatial audio, however, are exclusive to Samsung phones. If you use a phone from other brands, these features are not for you. But that does not mean everything else is also irrelevant. You get amazing sound quality, as well as noise cancellation, even if you have a Pixel, OnePlus, or Xiaomi phone. And you shouldn’t blame Samsung for it. Every brand is trying to create an ecosystem, as I said earlier, and moreover, it is easier and more convenient for a brand to offer its technologies through its own products. The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are comfortable to wear (Image: Shubham Verma) Calls are clearly audible in the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, and with environmental noise cancellation, my callers did not face the issue of disturbing background noise. Samsung also lets you turn on the natural sound functionality that would let you listen to your voice while on a call just so you don’t end up speaking loudly and startling people around you. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro noise cancellation The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro has the best kind of noise cancellation to offer. Active noise cancellation has improved drastically over years, and Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds 2 Pro will let you experience it. I won’t give you numbers — although Samsung has provided them, but talk about how effective the ANC is in different scenarios. I was able to isolate myself from the chatter in the coffee house using the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, and these earbuds became my good companion when hitting the gym. The soft fabric touch makes the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro look good (Image: Shubham Verma) Sitting and typing at my workstation became a little more enjoyable with the earbuds with ANC turned on and music playing on them. But when music is not playing, some sound can seep into your ears. The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro also has a voice detection feature that temporarily turns on the transparency mode and lowers the media volume significantly the moment it detects you are speaking. It is a good functionality, copied from Sony earbuds. I don’t care about who did it first as long as the implementation is good. I can say that Samsung has done a good job here. But people who like to mumble would want to avoid turning this feature on. For me, this feature turned out to be a mixed bag. For small talks with colleagues, this feature proved useful, but I like to karaoke to songs I am listening to. My voice turns on the voice detection feature, minimising the music volume. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro gestures and battery Gestures on the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are pretty standard. A single tap accepts calls, disconnects an ongoing call, and plays/pauses music. Double taps play the next track, while a long tap changes the noise cancellation mode. I did not find it hard to get accustomed to, but the earbuds are extremely sensitive. A slight touch can trigger the assigned programmes. I often put on an earbud when driving a bike and I have been annoyed by my helmet pausing and playing music. I am nitpicking. The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro run for about six hours with ANC turned on and eight hours without it on a single charge. Adding the charge from the case takes the total runtime to 18-19 hours with ANC and 28 hours without it. It is not a radical improvement over last-generation earbuds, but not bad either. The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro supports wireless charging, so when you need a trickle of battery charge, you can turn on power-sharing on your compatible Galaxy phone and charge the earbuds. The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro easily last for about 4-5 hours on a single charge (Image: Shubham Verma) Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro verdict The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are the best earbuds from Samsung. They offer the best of the three basic functionalities: sound quality, design, and noise cancellation. Apart from my small gripes, such as the lack of multipoint connections and exclusivity to Samsung phones, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro have nothing as big as a deal-breaker. Sure, they work to their fullest potential with Samsung phones, but they are still plenty good when you are using them with other phones. At Rs 17,999, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are the best bet for Samsung phone users, but if you have a phone of a different brand and you are a stickler for features such as spatial audio, you need to give in and enter an ecosystem.

His first move was to fire CEO Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and other top execs.Musk is taking the reins just ahead of a Friday deadline to complete the deal. The deal's closing will bring to an end the months-long legal battle that has engulfed Twitter since Musk first offered to buy the company in April, before announcing a couple weeks later that the acquisition was “on hold.” Musk, who declined to do due diligence before his offer, cited concerns about the number of bots and fake accounts on the platform. Twitter’s lawyers later argued that the bot issue was merely a “pretext” for him to renege on the deal.But finalizing the acquisition will be far from the end of turmoil within Twitter. Musk, who has criticized Twitter's leadership and clashed with Agrawal, has already fired at least four executives, including Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's top policy official, and Sean Edgett, the company's general counsel. The New York Timesreported that \"at least one\" executive was escorted from Twitter's office on Thursday.Musk, who changed his Twitter bio to “Chief Twit,” has made it clear he intends to bring big changes to the social media company. He has said both in public appearances and in private messages that he wants to relax Twitter’s moderation rules and that he dislikes permanent bans. He’s also likely to cut staff, though he has told employees he won’t cut 75 percent of employees as he was reportedly considering.Twitter’s core service could also dramatically change under Musk’s leadership. In addition to loosening moderation rules on the platform, Musk has said wants to “open source” Twitter’s algorithm so users could better understand its recommendations. At the same time, he’s tried to reassure advertisers that he doesn’t want the site to be a “free-for-all hellscape,” and that Twitter should be the “most respected advertising platform in the world.”Musk, who has often talked about his desire for Twitter to be “an accelerant to creating X, the everything app” akin to WeChat in China, is also likely to look for ways to increase non-advertising revenue.

Study: WHO fungal priority pathogens list to guide research, development and public health action. Geneva: World Health Organization. Image Credit: Lipskiy / Shutterstock.com Fungal pathogens are increasingly becoming a cause for concern, especially in individuals with underlying medical conditions that weaken the immune system, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), diabetes mellitus, cancer, and tuberculosis. Patients undergoing immune-suppressive therapies, organ transplants, chemotherapy, invasive medical procedures, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal and hepatic diseases are also at increased risk of invasive fungal infections. The incidence of aspergillosis, candidaemia, and mucormycosis have also increased in association with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A further challenge in this field is the emergence of antifungal resistance due to inappropriate antifungal use. Antifungal-resistant fungi such as Candida auris persist in hospitals and require second-line antifungal treatments that are often toxic. Only four classes of antifungals are currently in clinical use, all of which cause many adverse reactions. Furthermore, antifungal medications are often not readily available in low- and middle-income countries with greater disease burden. The present WHO FPPL report was released to increase awareness about priority fungal pathogens for implementing better surveillance, prevention, and control measures. The FPPL could lead to augmented investments in research and development of antifungal therapies and diagnostic methods, as well as support the establishment of public health policies focused on addressing fungal diseases and antifungal resistance. The report's target audience includes mycologists, healthcare providers, general practitioners, pharmaceutical industries, infectious disease, and mycology research institutes, diagnostic technology development industries, academic healthcare researchers, and ministries of health worldwide. Since fungal diseases are complex in their epidemiology, disease dynamics, global distribution, and risk factors, a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was adopted to create the FPPL. Apart from being reproducible and updatable, the MCDA approach allows various criteria, quantitative and qualitative evidence, and the expertise of different stakeholders to be combined. The WHO commissioned 19 systematic literature reviews to select 19 priority fungal pathogens based on ten assessment criteria. The assessment factors included mortality, annual incidence, global distribution, incidence and prevalence patterns over the last decade, duration of hospital stay required for treatment, long-term complications, antifungal resistance, diagnosis and treatment, and prevention options. The compiled data was used to produce a final ranking of the fungal pathogens. The MCDA prioritization process revealed that public health concerns had the most prominent role in determining the priority pathogens. Most respondents believed that antifungal resistance was the most important criterion, and top ranks were given to most antifungal-resistant pathogens. The systematic review revealed significant gaps in knowledge about deaths and susceptibility. Moreover, the review also found that epidemiology and global distribution patterns were significantly different for various fungal pathogens. The 19 fungal pathogens were divided into three groups based on critical, high, and medium priority. Aspergillus fumigatus , Candida albicans , Candida auris , and Cryptococcus neoformans were the critical priority pathogens. The high-priority group comprised Candida parapsilosisi , Candida tropicalisi, eumycetoma causative agents, Fusarium spp. , Histoplasma spp. , Mucorales, and Nakaseomyces glabrata (Candida glabrata). The medium priority group consisted of Coccidioides spp. , Cryptococcus gattii , Lomentospora prolificans , Paracoccidioides spp. , Pichia kudriavzeveii (Candida krusei) , Pneumocystis jirovecii , Scedosporium spp. , and Talaromyces marneffei . The WHO identified three broad priority areas for action, including increased surveillance, support for research and development, and improved public health interventions. Improved surveillance would require increased access to mycology laboratories, microscopy and culture tests, diagnostic tools and facilities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and advanced biopsy techniques. The research and development goals would be to design new antifungal drugs and improve existing treatments to increase their efficacy and reduce toxicity. In addition, developing new diagnostic methods to provide rapid, affordable, and accurate fungal identification and susceptibility determination would also be a priority. Enhanced public health measures would include increased medical training, new and improved infection prevention and control measures, and expanding access to quality, affordable, and equitable antifungal treatments.\nnews-medical\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/an-unprecedented-list-of-health-threatening-fungi-released-by-the-who/","tags":[],"title":"An unprecedented list of health-threatening fungi released by the WHO"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"New report highlights the health impacts of air pollution in Africa Nearly all the African continent faces some of the most severe health impacts in the world caused by air pollution, with several countries experiencing some of the highest levels of air pollution in the world, according to a new report published by the U.S.-based research organization Health Effects Institute.\nNearly all the African continent faces some of the most severe health impacts in the world caused by air pollution, with several countries experiencing some of the highest levels of air pollution in the world, according to a new report published by the U.S.-based research organization Health Effects Institute (HEI). The new report, The State of Air Quality and Health Impacts in Africa , provides a comprehensive analysis of major air pollution sources and related health impacts in the continent of more than 1.2 billion people. Released just before the U.N.'s upcoming COP27 Climate Change Conference in Egypt, the report finds that air pollution is the second leading risk factor for death across the continent. Africa is home to five of the top ten most heavily polluted countries worldwide in terms of outdoor fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ). Outdoor PM 2.5 is the most consistent predictor of deaths from cardiovascular, respiratory, and other diseases in studies of long-term exposure to air pollution. In 2019, air pollution contributed to an estimated 1.1 million deaths in Africa, with 63% linked to exposure to household air pollution (HAP). Access to clean energy across Africa is not equitably distributed, leading to larger disease burdens in certain areas. Across East, West, Central, and Southern Africa, an estimated 75% of the population relies on burning solid fuels such as coal, wood, and charcoal for cooking, exposing residents to high concentrations of harmful pollutants at home every day. Newborns and children under five years old in these regions are at a particularly high risk from household air pollution linked to use of solid fuels for cooking. In 2019, 14% of all deaths in children under five across Africa were linked to air pollution. The impacts on newborns and infants also have long-term consequences for overall health, including issues with lung development and increased susceptibility to communicable diseases such as lower respiratory infections in young children. Caradee Wright, Chief Specialist Scientist with the South African Medical Research Council, said, \"This report gives evidence of the substantial threat air pollution poses to the health, and even life, of babies and children under the age of 5 years. This vulnerable group needs special attention to mitigate their exposures, for example, through policy and intensive awareness campaigns with practical solutions for mothers and caregivers.\" In Africa, PM 2.5 comes from many of the same sources found elsewhere in the world, including use of solid fuels for cooking, fossil fuel use (coal, oil, and gas) for energy production, vehicles, industrial and semi-industrial activities like artisanal mining, agriculture, forest fires, and open waste fire pits. In parts of Africa, windblown dust, a natural source of air pollution, is also a major contributor to PM 2.5 levels. Air pollution sources and related health impacts can vary widely across the continent. By region, Western Africa experiences the highest PM 2.5 pollution with an average concentration of 64.1 μg/m 3 , while Southern Africa has the lowest at 26.5 μg/m 3 . In Southern Africa, use of fossil fuels contributes as much as 41% of the total outdoor PM 2.5 levels, whereas in Eastern Africa, the contribution is only 11%. While air pollution levels are high, countries across Africa are implementing a wide range of programs to lower the impacts of air pollution. So far, 17 countries in Africa have established some national air quality policies, and many have included action on air pollution sources, especially household air pollution, as part of their country's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). In 2019, Africa had one of the lowest energy access rates in the world, with fewer than one in 20 people living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Niger, Uganda, and Tanzania having access to clean fuels for cooking. At the same time, a scarcity of ground level air quality monitoring stations means countries are not able to accurately track their progress towards meeting air quality objectives and standards. Dr. Patrick de Marie Katoto of the Catholic University of Bukavu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, said, \"Air pollution greatly contributes to the rising frequency of chronic noncommunicable diseases in Africa, putting further strain on a health system already stretched by chronic infectious diseases and, more recently, COVID-19. These findings call for the African Union and member states to promote, plan, and fund air quality interventions to prevent unnecessary disabilities and deaths throughout the continent.\" As the world's nations convene next month in Egypt for the COP27 climate meetings, Africa will consider how energy transitions can be designed to be efficient, economically feasible, sustainable, and environmentally friendly-;a complex challenge that requires a nuanced conversation at the nexus of energy, climate, air quality, and health. Countries in the African Union have also adopted the \"Agenda 2063,\" a continent-wide program that lays out a strategic framework designed to deliver on its goal for inclusive and sustainable development for all residents by the year 2063. Meeting these challenges head-on will bring dual benefits of public health improvements and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across Africa. This report is released in coordination with a new report from the Clean Air Fund that examines how action on air pollution could free up billions of dollars, prevent thousands of deaths, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% by 2040.

Made possible with a $1.5 million grant from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, this initiative will implement the newly developed American Heart Association Post-Acute Stroke Care Quality Standards program in rehabilitation facilities across the three states, where the Trust recently supported efforts under the American Heart Association Mission: Lifeline ® Stroke initiative. Adoption of the program will maximize recovery of function lost during a stroke, reduce risk of secondary effects, and extend high quality guideline-directed care for all patients across their full stroke journey. The Helmsley Charitable Trust previously funded the development and piloting of the Post-Acute Stroke Care Quality Standards program. Across the U.S., approximately half of all stroke patients are discharged to in-patient rehabilitation, skilled nursing facilities, and long-term care facilities. Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability and more than 11% suffer a second stroke within a year. Yet, post-acute care is often siloed from the rest of the health care system and inconsistent across care delivery settings. Targeted, high-quality post-stroke rehabilitation interventions, customized to patient needs, can dramatically improve recovery of function lost during a stroke, but current gaps in the system of care can lead to high rates of hospital readmissions, variability in care coordination and sub-optimal outcomes for patients. This new initiative will help to ensure patients receive the most up-to-date science-informed care to improve recovery and reduce disability after experiencing a stroke.\" Joel Stein, M.D., volunteer co-chair of the Association's standards writing committee and physiatrist-in-chief and chair of the Department of Rehabilitation and Regenerative Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in Irving, California The new initiative seeks to establish post-acute care as a core component in the system of stroke care. Participating facilities will test the new standards to create benchmarks of success against which facilities nationwide will be able to assess their care. This work expands on initiatives to strengthen the full spectrum of stroke care through the Association's Mission: Lifeline ® Stroke program. Mission: Lifeline Stroke focuses on connecting all components of acute stroke care into a smoothly integrated system that reinforces the use of evidence-based guidelines to timely and effectively treat stroke patients.

Using the technology, the team showed how they could identify specific cell types, detect and measure changes in the expression of individual genes, track transcriptional states, and control the production of proteins encoded by synthetic mRNA. The platform, called Reprogrammable ADAR Sensors, or RADARS, even allowed the team to target and kill a specific cell type. The team said RADARS could one day help researchers detect and selectively kill tumor cells, or edit the genome in specific cells. The study appears today in Nature Biotechnology and was led by co-first authors Kaiyi Jiang (MIT), Jeremy Koob (Broad), Xi Chen (Broad), Rohan Krajeski (MIT), and Yifan Zhang (Broad). \"One of the revolutions in genomics has been the ability to sequence the transcriptomes of cells,\" said Fei Chen, a core institute member at the Broad, Merkin Fellow, assistant professor at Harvard University, and co-corresponding author on the study. \"That has really allowed us to learn about cell types and states. But, often, we haven't been able to manipulate those cells specifically. RADARS is a big step in that direction.\" Right now, the tools that we have to leverage cell markers are hard to develop and engineer. We really wanted to make a programmable way of sensing and responding to a cell state.\" Omar Abudayyeh, a McGovern Institute Fellow and Study's Co-Corresponding Author Jonathan Gootenberg, who is also a McGovern Institute Fellow and co-corresponding author, says that their team was eager to build a tool to take advantage of all the data provided by single-cell RNA sequencing, which has revealed a vast array of cell types and cell states in the body. \"We wanted to ask how we could manipulate cellular identities in a way that was as easy as editing the genome with CRISPR,\" he said. \"And we're excited to see what the field does with it.\" The RADARS platform generates a desired protein when it detects a specific RNA by taking advantage of RNA editing that occurs naturally in cells. The system consists of an RNA containing two components: a guide region, which binds to the target RNA sequence that scientists want to sense in cells, and a payload region, which encodes the protein of interest, such as a fluorescent signal or a cell-killing enzyme. When the guide RNA binds to the target RNA, this generates a short double-stranded RNA sequence containing a mismatch between two bases in the sequence -; adenosine (A) and cytosine (C). This mismatch attracts a naturally occurring family of RNA-editing proteins called adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). In RADARS, the A-C mismatch appears within a \"stop signal\" in the guide RNA, which prevents the production of the desired payload protein. The ADARs edit and inactivate the stop signal, allowing for the translation of that protein. The order of these molecular events is key to RADARS's function as a sensor; the protein of interest is produced only after the guide RNA binds to the target RNA and the ADARs disable the stop signal. The team tested RADARS in different cell types and with different target sequences and protein products. They found that RADARS distinguished between kidney, uterine, and liver cells, and could produce different fluorescent signals as well as a caspase, an enzyme that kills cells. RADARS also measured gene expression over a large dynamic range, demonstrating their utility as sensors. Most systems successfully detected target sequences using the cell's native ADAR proteins, but the team found that supplementing the cells with additional ADAR proteins increased the strength of the signal. Abudayyeh says both of these cases are potentially useful; taking advantage of the cell's native editing proteins would minimize the chance of off-target editing in therapeutic applications, but supplementing them could help produce stronger effects when RADARS are used as a research tool in the lab. Abudayyeh, Chen, and Gootenberg say that because both the guide RNA and payload RNA are modifiable, others can easily redesign RADARS to target different cell types and produce different signals or payloads. They also engineered more complex RADARS, in which cells produced a protein if they sensed two RNA sequences and another if they sensed either one RNA or another. The team adds that similar RADARS could help scientists detect more than one cell type at the same time, as well as complex cell states that can't be defined by a single RNA transcript. Ultimately, the researchers hope to develop a set of design rules so that others can more easily develop RADARS for their own experiments. They suggest other scientists could use RADARS to manipulate immune cell states, track neuronal activity in response to stimuli, or deliver therapeutic mRNA to specific tissues. \"We think this is a really interesting paradigm for controlling gene expression,\" said Chen. \"We can't even anticipate what the best applications will be. That really comes from the combination of people with interesting biology and the tools you develop.\" Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard Jiang, K., et al.

However, many patients do not respond to immunotherapy. For instance, among highly-mutated colorectal and endometrial cancers, research has shown that only half will show a response to immunotherapy. A new study by Yale School of Medicine researchers published Oct. 27 in the journal Cancer Discovery , a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, has identified a possible explanation for why this happens. In an analysis of a phase 2 trial investigating the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab in 24 patients with endometrial cancer, the Yale team identifies a specific mechanism of faulty DNA repair in tumors as a key factor in determining patient outcomes. We wanted to understand why some patients respond better than others to immunotherapy.\" Ryan Chow, Co-Corresponding Author, M.D./Ph.D. Candidate, Yale's Department of Genetics and the Systems Biology Institute For the study, the Yale team focused on the failure of a process known as \"mismatch repair.\" When cells divide, errors often arise in their DNA. Through mismatch repair, a special group of proteins recognizes and corrects errors in the DNA. A breakdown in this editing process occurs in many different types of cancer, however, leading to high mutation levels. The research team -; led by Chow, Dr. Eric Song, an ophthalmology resident and former M.D./Ph.D. student at Yale, and Dr. Alessandro Santin, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences -; zeroed in on the fact that mismatch repair deficiency can result from two distinct mechanisms. In one, mutations occur in the DNA repair machinery itself, leading to the production of defective repair proteins; in the second, production of the DNA repair machinery is halted entirely. In both cases, the tumors accumulate very high levels of mutations that would be expected to make them good candidates for immunotherapy. \"An analogy would be a dysfunctional toy factory,\" Chow said. \"Maybe the factory makes broken toys that don't work, or the factory has no personnel and stops producing toys altogether. Either way, kids won't be happy.\" However, the researchers found that tumors with defective DNA repair proteins had significantly better responses to immunotherapy than those in which the production of DNA repair proteins had been silenced. These differences could ultimately be traced to changes in the immune response that was mounted against each of the two classes of tumors, they said. \"When it comes to immunotherapy, it seems that the journey -; in this case, the underlying cause of mismatch repair deficiency -; may be just as important as the destination,\" Chow said. Added Song: \"The innovative use of clinical trial data can guide our understanding of how immunotherapy manipulates the immune system and ultimately improve how we treat patients.\" Santin is part of the Yale Cancer Center and Song is a resident at Smilow Cancer Hospital.

The creators of this therapy, which can successfully activate the immune system to fight cancer, won the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The findings reported by the authors were based on experiments involving cells from patients treated in intensive care units (ICUs) after being infected by SARS-CoV-2, and mice infected by MHV-A59 (murine hepatitis virus A59), another betacoronavirus. \"PD-1 blockade is one of the known immune checkpoint therapies and one of the therapies we analyzed in the study. It tells T lymphocytes [ a type of white blood cell ] to stop responding to infection after a time so that the response is not excessive. In cases of cancer, sepsis and severe COVID-19, however, PD-1 makes T cells stop functioning even before the disease has been resolved and must therefore be blocked,\" said Pedro Moraes-Vieira, one of the leaders of the study. Moraes-Vieira is a professor at the State University of Campinas's Institute of Biology (IB-UNICAMP) in São Paulo, Brazil, and supported by FAPESP. Another co-author is Gustavo Gastão Davanzo, a PhD candidate at IB-UNICAMP with a scholarship from FAPESP. These are very expensive treatments, but we believe it could be a viable option because there aren't as many critical patients as there were at the start of the pandemic, provided further research confirms that it's safe for COVID-19 patients.\" Pedro Moraes-Vieira, Professor, State University of Campinas's Institute of Biology, São Paulo, Brazil The hypothesis tested in the study arose when Uruguayan researchers (co-authors of the article) observed that mice that did not express the protein TMEM176D responded more acutely to infection by MHV-A59. This protein regulates inflammasomes, protein complexes deployed by the innate immune system to trigger inflammation as a weapon against tumors, viruses and bacteria. Inflammasome activation is more intense without TMEM176D. More inflammatory cytokines are released, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), which is known to play a role in severe COVID-19 ( more at: agencia.fapesp.br/34732/ ). \"Excessive release of IL-1β leads to T lymphocyte dysfunction, which we call T cell exhaustion,\" Moraes-Vieira said. \"These cells are so strongly activated that they can no longer respond adequately. This is common in chronic viral diseases like severe COVID-19, as we found in a study conducted early in the pandemic.\" An article on the study in question, published in 2020 in Cell Metabolism , is one of the most cited articles published in this journal in the last three years and motivated the Uruguayan team to propose a partnership ( more at: agencia.fapesp.br/33296/ ). In the trials involving mice, treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor restored T cell functionality. In addition, the researchers had access to blood from healthy donors and COVID-19 patients hospitalized at two institutions in Montevideo, Uruguay's capital. Experiments involving healthy cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 were conducted at UNICAMP's Laboratory of Emerging Virus Studies (LEVE) headed by Professor José Luiz Proença Módena, a co-author of the article, with support from FAPESP. In trials involving human blood samples, only cells that came from patients in intensive care benefited from the administration of atezolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor used in the study. This was because of inflammasome overactivation leading to exhaustion and dysfunction of adaptive immunity in these patients. The findings should be considered with caution, the researchers warn. Studies involving cancer patients who were treated in this manner before contracting COVID-19 showed no benefits or pointed to negative results. In one study, administration of the therapy before viral infection did not lead to an improvement in COVID-19. In another study, involving 423 patients, there were more cases of hospitalization and severe disease among those who had been given the inhibitor. On the other hand, a clinical trial of PD-1 inhibitors in sepsis patients showed the therapy to be safe. More research will therefore be needed to glean a deeper understanding of the effects of the treatment in the context of COVID-19. São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) Vega, M.D., et al.

The Study of Tecovirimat for Human Monkeypox Virus (STOMP) is a Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial , funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and led by the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG), the world's largest and longest running HIV clinical trials network. The AntiViral Research Center (AVRC) at UC San Diego School of Medicine is part of ACTG. There is an urgent need for MPOX treatments and this study will help us determine whether tecovirimat should be one of them.

The County of San Diego has documented 440 cases, as of October 22. MPOX was first identified in 1958 and has caused an increasing number of infections annually in endemic countries, primarily portions of Africa. The current outbreak has been characterized primarily by increased person-to-person transmission. Close contact during sexual activity is believed to play an important role in the current outbreak. While most cases have been reported among men who have sex with men, women, children and men who have sex with women have also been infected. There are currently no therapies approved to treat human MPOX. TPOXX is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat smallpox, but its safety and effectiveness against MPOX is unknown. The MPOX virus belongs to the same family of viruses as variola virus. MPOX symptoms are similar to smallpox symptoms, but milder, and MPOX is rarely fatal. MPOX is not related to chickenpox . The new trial, with more than 60 sites, will enroll more than 500 adults with MPOX virus infections. The trial will include people with severe disease and those at high risk of severe disease, including pregnant and breastfeeding persons, children and individuals with underlying immune deficiency and active inflammatory skin conditions who will receive open-label tecovirimat. Study participants with symptomatic MPOX virus infection who do not meet the criteria for the open-label cohort will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either tecovirimat or a placebo orally for 14 days. Participants who are randomized in the double-blinded cohort who subsequently progress to severe disease will be offered the option to switch to open-label tecovirimat, as will participants who report persistent severe pain from MPOX virus infection. All STOMP participants will be followed for at least eight weeks through a combination of virtual and in-person visits, and daily self-reports to determine if those receiving tecovirimat heal more quickly compared to those receiving the placebo. STOMP will also provide critical data on the optimal dosing and safety of tecovirimat in children and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Individuals who have presumptive or confirmed MPOX infections (testing positive within seven days) and who begin experiencing symptoms within 13 days are eligible. Testing will be provided by the study. Participants with presumptive MPOX who have not yet been tested are able to enroll as long as their study-provided test is positive. Participants must also have at least one active skin lesion that has not yet scabbed, a mouth lesion or proctitis (inflammation in the lining of the rectum). \"The ACTG has designed this study to give us the greatest possible insights into whether and how tecovirimat works against monkeypox, including whether the virus develops resistance to the treatment,\" said ACTG chair Judith Currier, MD, professor of medicine at UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. \"An important part of that design is the inclusion of children and pregnant people.

Researchers explore the association between maternal insulin resistance with fetal fat deposition.\nIn a recent American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology study, researchers explore the association between maternal insulin resistance during the early, middle, and late stages of an uncomplicated pregnancy with fetal fat deposition to understand the influence of maternal glucose regulation during gestation on child adiposity. Study: Maternal insulin resistance in pregnancy is associated with fetal fat deposition: findings from a longitudinal study . Image Credit: vovidzha / Shutterstock.com A growing body of research indicates that prenatal accrual adipose tissue in the fetus impacts childhood and adult obesity, which is a serious health concern. During fetal development, adipogenesis occurs mainly during the middle and late gestation periods. This process is influenced by the maternal nutritional environment, especially glucose and insulin concentrations. Several studies have reported associations between newborn adiposity and maternal conditions during pregnancy, such as maternal body mass index (BMI) and gestation weight gain. However, while the relationship between fetal fat deposition and maternal glucose sensitivity has been established, the influence of maternal insulin resistance and its gestational timing on fetal fat deposition remains unclear. In the present study, researchers performed a longitudinal study of 137 normal pregnancies. They used fetal ultrasonography images and fasting maternal blood samples to investigate the longitudinal and cross-sectional associations between maternal insulin resistance and fetal adiposity. Participants were excluded if they had uterine anomalies, hypertension, diabetes, other pre-existing comorbidities, renal, endocrine, or hepatic disorders, chromosomal abnormalities, congenital disorders, a history of smoking or drug use, or were receiving systemic corticosteroids. Insulin resistance during gestation was measured using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Maternal venous blood was collected at 12, 20, and 30 weeks of pregnancy to measure fasting insulin concentrations and plasma glucose levels. The periods were decided based on evidence of changing endocrine parameters during gestation. Two-dimensional (2D) fetal ultrasonography was performed within four days of maternal blood sample collection to obtain head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and biparietal diameter measurements, all of which were used to estimate fetal weight. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography was then used to measure fat mass at the mid-upper arm, abdomen, and mid-thigh at 20 and 30 weeks, but not at 12 weeks, as histologically evident fetal fat deposition only occurs after 14 to 16 weeks. Self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and height measured during the first prenatal hospital visit were used to calculate maternal BMI. Medical records during the pregnancy were used to calculate gestational weight gain, which was then characterized as adequate, inadequate, or excessive. The data were then analyzed to estimate fetal adiposity, with statistical analyses used to identify correlations between maternal glucose sensitivity and fetal fat deposition. Maternal HOMA-IR levels during mid and late gestation positively correlate with estimated fetal adiposity but not with estimated fetal weight. In addition, the HOMA-IR values were significantly associated with race and ethnicity, with Hispanic mothers having higher HOMA-IR values than non-Hispanic mothers. The correlation between fetal adiposity and maternal HOMA-IR at 20 and 30 weeks of gestation remained significant, even after adjusting for maternal BMI, race, and ethnicity. The correlation also did not significantly change after excluding mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus . Taken together, maternal insulin levels during mid-gestation could serve as an essential biomarker to detect the risk of fetal adiposity, thereby providing time for clinical interventions before maximum fetal fat deposition occurs. Since fat deposition in the fetus can be histologically observed only between 14-16 weeks, the short window between then and 20 weeks could be critically important in detecting maternal insulin resistance and evaluating the risks of fetal adiposity and future childhood adiposity. Mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus detected before 24-28 weeks are at a higher risk of complicated pregnancies than mothers diagnosed during the third trimester. Similar early screening of maternal glucose sensitivity could help predict obesity risks for the child. One of the proposed mechanisms to explain the correlation between maternal insulin resistance and fetal adiposity included the increased trans-placental transport of glucose to the fetus, which would elevate the pancreatic beta cell function and increase fetal insulin levels. Higher fetal insulin levels increase glucose uptake, thus stimulating the liver to store excess glucose as triglycerides and glycogen. The current study explored the association between maternal insulin resistance at different stages of gestation and fetal adiposity. The results suggested a strong correlation between maternal glucose sensitivity and fetal fat deposition during the middle and late-gestation periods, which remained significant after accounting for gestational diabetes mellitus, maternal BMI, race, and ethnicity. Mid-gestation maternal insulin resistance can be an important biomarker to assess fetal, newborn, and childhood obesity risks.\nnews-medical\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/does-maternal-insulin-tolerance-during-pregnancy-influence-child-adiposity/","tags":[],"title":"Does maternal insulin tolerance during pregnancy influence child adiposity?"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"Unprecedented COVID spikes could overwhelm local jurisdictions, mathematical model suggests America was unprepared for the magnitude of the pandemic, which overwhelmed many counties and filled some hospitals to capacity.\nAmerica was unprepared for the magnitude of the pandemic, which overwhelmed many counties and filled some hospitals to capacity. A new paper in PNAS suggests there may have been a mathematical method, of sorts, to the madness of those early COVID days. The study tests a model that closely matches the patterns of case counts and deaths reported, county by county, across the United States between April 2020 and June 2021. The model suggests that unprecedented COVID spikes could, even now, overwhelm local jurisdictions. Our best estimate, based on the data, is that the numbers of cases and deaths per county have infinite variance, which means that a county could get hit with a tremendous number of cases or deaths. We cannot reasonably anticipate that any county will have the resources to cope with extremely large, rare events, so it is crucial that counties-;as well as states and even countries-;develop plans, ahead of time, to share resources.\" Joel Cohen, Rockefeller University Ecologists might have guessed that the spread of COVID cases and deaths would at least roughly conform to Taylor's Law, a formula that relates a population's mean to its variance (a measure of the scatter around the average). From how crop yields fluctuate, to the frequency of tornado outbreaks, to how cancer cells multiply, Taylor's Law forms the backbone of many statistical models that experts use to describe thousands of species, including humans. But when Cohen began looking into whether Taylor's Law could also describe the grim COVID statistics provided by The New York Times, he ran into a surprise. Ninety-nine percent of counties' counts of cases and deaths between April 2020 and June 2021 conformed to a \"lognormal\" distribution of Taylor's Law, which predicts that the variance of cases or deaths in each location will be proportional to the squared mean of cases or deaths. For example, if the average number of cases per county is 50 in Arizona and 100 in California, this version of Taylor's Law would predict that the scatter of case counts in California would be four times larger than the scatter of case counts in Arizona. Similarly, if the case counts per county in those two states were 50 and 150, respectively, the scatter would be nine times larger in California. The top one percent of counts of cases and deaths, however, did not fit the lognormal distribution. Instead, the high counts matched the Pareto distribution-;a model more often seen in economics than biology, in which extremely high values are rarely but regularly observed (think: income or wealth distribution). What made this particular Pareto distribution unique was that it also had infinite variance, implying that the scatter would increase beyond any finite limit, the more counts of cases or deaths observed. The challenge was to understand why even the top 1% of counts still conformed to Taylor's Law with the same exponent as the lower 99%. \"It was a puzzle,\" Cohen recalls. \"And I sat on that puzzle, every so often taking it out, torturing it a bit, and putting it away. Until, one day, I called in the heavy artillery.\" Cohen sent his computer simulations and unproved conjectures to Richard A. Davis of Columbia University and Gennady Samorodnitsky of Cornell University, asking for their input. A few months later, the two sent him some theorems: the missing proof that Taylor's Law would hold even for the Pareto-distributed top 1% of counties, with the same exponent as the 99% of lognormally distributed counties. \"These theorems helped prove that Taylor's Law accurately describes all of the data,\" Cohen says. \"The pandemic produced an orderly pattern of counts of cases per county and deaths per county. The unexpected part of that order was that, in the most extreme cases, there was no limit to how bad things could get.\" Why the pandemic follows this hybrid (lognormal-Pareto) version of Taylor's Law so closely is unclear. One possibility is that Taylor's Law-;which describes the variance of many ecological systems, including infectious diseases like measles and Chagas's disease-;simply captures the nature of infection. If one patient infects two people (with some probability) and each of those two patients infect another two people (with some probability), we would expect cases to increase exponentially (with some probability), and occasional random events could cause infinite variance. Cohen hopes that the study will sound an alarm for policymakers. An infinite variance of cases and deaths per county means that there is a very unlikely but possible scenario in which a COVID spike gets every individual in that county sick, or worse. Although the advent of vaccines makes such a scenario increasingly unlikely, areas in the United States and abroad with low vaccination rates still face the possibility of spikes that they cannot handle. The math, Cohen says, suggests that COVID cases and deaths could far exceed the capacity of local jurisdictions to cope. \"Governments had better be prepared to call in their friends,\" he says.

And we're not alone-;most animals reduce those same three behaviors when they're fighting an infection.\nWe tend to eat, drink, and move less when we're feeling under the weather. And we're not alone-;most animals reduce those same three behaviors when they're fighting an infection. Now, a new study pinpoints the cluster of neurons that control these responses, referred to as sickness behaviors. By provoking immune responses in mice, researchers demonstrated that a specific population of cells in the brainstem potently induce three telltale sickness behaviors. In addition, inhibiting these neurons blunts each of these behavioral elements of the sickness response. The findings, published in Nature , directly link inflammation to neural pathways regulating behavior, offering insight into how the immune system interacts with the brain. We are still in the early days of trying to understand the brain's role in infection. But with these results, we now have a unique opportunity to ask: What does your brain look like when you're sick?\" Jeffrey M. Friedman, Marilyn M. Simpson Professor at The Rockefeller University Sickness behaviors have been shown to play an important role in an animal's recovery from an infection. Prior studies have bolstered that theory by demonstrating that animals forced to eat when they're sick showed a significantly increased mortality. \"These behavioral changes during infection are really important for survival,\" says lead author Anoj Ilanges, a former graduate student in Friedman's lab, now a group leader at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus But it has never been clear how the brain coordinates that near-universal urge to refuse meals and curl up under the covers with the onset of infection. So Friedman and Ilanges set out to map the brain regions behind sickness behaviors in mice. The team began by exposing mice to LPS, a piece of bacterial cell wall that activates the immune system and potently induces sickness behavior. Shortly after an injection of LPS, there was a spike in activity in a brainstem region known as the dorsal vagal complex, among a population of neurons expressing the neuropeptide ADCYAP1. To confirm that they had found the right brain cells, the researchers then activated those neurons in healthy mice and they found that the animals ate, drank, and moved around less. In contrast, when the ADCYAP1 neurons were deactivated , the effect of LPS on these behaviors was significantly reduced. \"We didn't know if the same or different neurons regulated each of these behaviors,\" Friedman says, \"We found it surprising that a single neuronal population appears to regulate each of these components of the sickness response.\" The authors were not, however, altogether surprised that this brainstem region was involved in mediating sickness behaviors. The dorsal vagal complex is one of a precious few physiological crossroads of the central nervous system, where an absence of the blood brain barrier enables circulating factors in the blood to pass information directly to the brain. \"This region has emerged as a kind of alert center for the brain, conveying information about aversive or noxious substances that, more often than not, reduce food intake,\" Friedman says. In the coming months, Friedman's team at Rockefeller intends to incorporate these findings into their overall goal of understanding the physiological signals and neural circuitry that regulate feeding behavior. They are specifically interested in understanding why even mice engineered to eat voraciously will nonetheless stop eating when exposed to bacterial infections. Meanwhile, Ilanges plans to investigate what role other brain regions play in response to infections, expanding our knowledge of the brain's role during this critical process. \"We looked at one region of the brain, but there are many others that become activated with the immune response,\" he says. \"This opens the door to asking what the brain is doing, holistically, during infection.\" Rockefeller University Ilanges, A., et al.

Batting first after winning the toss, the Proteas notched up an imposing 205/5 in the Group 2 encounter. Their bowlers then bundled out Bangladesh for 101 in 16.3 overs. South Africa’s batting stint got off to a poor start as skipper Temba Bavuma’s horror run with the willow continued. The opener was caught behind for 2, poking at an away-going delivery from Taskin Ahmed. Rilee Rossouw (109 off 56) and Quinton de Kock (63 off 38) then featured in a massive second-wicket stand of 168 - a new record for the highest partnership in the T20 World Cup. De Kock carried on from where he left off against Zimbabwe, striking seven fours and three sixes. Rossouw, on the other hand, notched up his second successive T20I hundred. In his previous T20I innings, he had clobbered an unbeaten 100 off 48 balls against India in Indore. The aggressive left-hander whacked seven fours and eight sixes in his outstanding knock. Instagram Post The brilliant partnership was broken when De Kock miscued a full delivery from Afif Hossain to long-off. Tristan Stubbs (7) fell cheaply to Shakib Al Hasan, who also ended Rossouw’s stay, having him caught at cover. The bowling side did well in the last couple of overs to restrict South Africa to under 220. Bangladesh were never in the hurt during their chase as Anrich Nortje (4/10) sent back openers Soumya Sarkar (9) and Najmul Hossain Shanto (9) in a fiery opening spell. Nortje also dismissed Bangladesh skipper Shakib, trapping his lbw for 1. Bangladesh were four down before the end of the powerplay as Kagiso Rabada sent Afif Hossain (1) on his way. Left-arm spinner Tabraiz Shamsi ran through the lower-order to finish with impressive figures of 3/20 from his four overs. Fittingly, Nortje brought the curtains down on the game, knocking over Taskin for 10. Rossouw was in unstoppable form as he carried on the momentum from the hundred in India. His knock effectively shut Bangladesh out of the contest even before they walked out to bat. De Kock provided him fine support, ensuring the runs kept flowing from both ends. Instagram Post With the ball, Nortje rattled Bangladesh’s batters with his pace, while Shamsi also made an impact, claiming three scalps. Rossouw was named Player of the Match for setting up the game with his fantastic ton.

While Web3 encompasses a wide array of technologies and applications, the core premise is a new generation of the world wide web that is built on the idea of decentralization . That’s about as deep as I can get into the subject of Web3 before I start to lose my way but needless to say, there are a lot of people backing this technology and it could very well be the future of the web. Back in 2018, Google didn’t seem to want anything to do with blockchain or the native currencies that fueled the technology. So much so that the company went so far as to ban cryptocurrency advertising in its massive ad network that accounts for the majority of Alphabet’s earnings. This move wasn’t intended to resist Web3 or blockchain technology but was geared more toward protecting Google’s user base from the volatile and often scam-rampant crypto ecosystem. It took more than three years for Google to reverse its ban on cryptocurrency advertising but now, the search giant appears to be fully embracing the Web3 movement and the blockchain technology behind it. Earlier this month, Google announced a strategic partnership with the well-known cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase that will “accelerate web3 adoption and innovation.” The union will consist of four key segments. For Google, select customers in the Web3 ecosystem will have the option to pay for Google Cloud services using cryptocurrencies through the Coinbase Commerce payment platform . Google will also grant Web3 developers to the company’s blockchain data using BigQuery. This will allow Web3 developers to operate Web3 systems without the overhead of expensive infrastructures. Additionally, Google will utilize Coinbase Prime for future institutional crypto payments and services. This is a good indicator that Alphabet is, at least, considering implementing more crypto payment options into the company’s services. We’re proud Coinbase has chosen Google Cloud as its strategic cloud partner, and we’re ready to serve the thriving global Web3 customer and partner ecosystem. Our focus is making it frictionless for all customers to take advantage of our scalability, reliability, security, and data services, so they can focus on innovation in the Web3 space. Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud On Coinbase’s end, the massive cryptocurrency exchange will move its data-related applications from the long-used AWS platform to Google’s Cloud infrastructure. As a crypto payment processor, Coinbase will earn fees from transactions through Coinbase Commerce. The partnership signals a massive shift in the crypto ecosystem as tech companies prepare for the Web3 revolution. You can find more details on the new partnership in the Google Cloud Press Room .

U.S. Senator Reminds Powell of Fed’s Dual Mandate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is facing political pressure over interest rate hike decisions. U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), chair of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, sent a letter to Powell on Tuesday asking him to consider the Fed’s dual mandate before making any decision to raise interest rates in the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Senator Brown wrote: As you know, the Federal Reserve is charged with the dual mandate of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the U.S. economy. “It is your job to combat inflation, but at the same time, you must not lose sight of your responsibility to ensure that we have full employment,” the lawmaker stressed. “For working Americans who already feel the crush of inflation, job losses will make it much worse. We can’t risk the livelihoods of millions of Americans who can’t afford it,” Brown continued, elaborating: I ask that you don’t forget your responsibility to promote maximum employment and that the decisions you make at the next FOMC meeting reflect your commitment to the dual mandate. A Fed spokesman reportedly confirmed that Powell received the letter Brown sent, noting that the normal policy is to respond to such communication directly. Commenting on Brown’s letter to Powell, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, was quoted by CNBC as saying: “Chair Powell has made it pretty clear that the necessary conditions for the Fed to achieve its full employment is low and stable inflation. Without low and stable inflation, there’s no way to achieve full employment.” He added: He’ll stick to his guns on this. I don’t see this as having any material impact on decision-making at the Fed. LPL Financial’s chief equity strategist, Quincy Krosby, opined: “The democratization of the Fed is the issue for the market, how much power the other members have vs. the chairman. It’s difficult to know.” Regarding Brown’s letter, the strategist said, “I don’t think it’s going to affect him,” noting: He knows the pressure. He knows that the politicians are increasingly nervous about losing their seats. There’s very little he could do at this point, by the way, to help either party. Bleakley Advisory Group’s chief investment officer, Peter Boockvar, commented: “I don’t necessarily think that Powell will buckle to the political pressure, but I’m wondering whether some of his colleagues start to, some of the doves who have become hawkish … Employment’s fine now, but as months go on and growth continues to slow and layoffs begin to increase at a more notable pace, I have to believe that the level of pressure is going to grow.” Do you think the Federal Reserve is influenced by political pressure regarding interest rate hikes?

With that, the Pixel Watch has a lot of sensors packed into the 41mm frame, such as a heart rate, ECG, and even a blood oxygen sensor – though the last one isn’t enabled. Here’s a list of each one and what they do for you. The Pixel Watch is an interesting product because it’s a Wear OS device but natively integrates Fitbit health tracking . Fitbit is a separate company – owned by Google – that has a vast line of health trackers and fitness wearables. Those wearables are regarded as great products that track vitals and well-being statistics very well. Though the line is nice, none of Fitbit’s devices run Wear OS, which leaves out a key part of Android integration that you see with Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 5 or something similar. The Pixel Watch, however, integrates perfectly with the Pixel phone series as well as other Android devices, while also packing a suite of health-tracking features designed and tuned by Fitbit. With that, the Pixel watch packs a total of eight different sensors, with just four tracking your vitals. The rest are for general watch use, though they pull their weight. Health sensors on the Pixel Watch There are four main health sensors on the Pixel Watch. Three help gather data related to your heart rate, sleep quality and time, and your step count. Beyond that, Fitbit crunches the numbers to determine in-depth information such as your stress levels and how many calories you’ve burned throughout the day. Optical heart rate sensor The optical heart rate sensor might be the most self-explanatory sensor on this Pixel Watch. Using powerful sensors, the optical lens captures minuscule movements in your skin to determine when your heart is pushing blood through your veins. That little green light that shines in your Pixel Watch is the heart rate sensor doing its job. Since blood absorbs green, the pulsing green light helps the sensor determine blood flow. That data is collected once every second by your Pixel Watch, and there’s no way to turn it off. Whenever you wear the watch, you’re getting accurate readings of your heartbeat throughout the day. The data collected is then compiled for you to view your patterns and heart rate extremes. Multipurpose electrical sensor The Pixel Watch has the ability to collect ECG – electrocardiogram – readings. Those readings determine whether or not you seem to have an AFib – atrial fibrillation – heartbeat. In essence, that means your heart rate is irregular and could point to signs of other health issues. To collect ECG data, the Pixel Watch uses an electrical sensor, which senses signals passing through the watch. This is why you need to touch your finger to the crown during an ECG reading. Electricity passes from your finger to your wrist through the Pixel Watch, giving the sensor a clear reading of what’s going on. Note: The ECG feature on the Pixel Watch is only available in certain regions. Learn more from Fitbit . Accelerometer An accelerometer is just a fancy pedometer in that it calculates the number of steps you take and checks them with your acceleration. Using those estimates, an accelerometer can determine how many steps you’re actually taking given how fast you’re moving. While still not 100% accurate, the Pixel Watch does a good job of estimating your steps to give you a pretty accurate readout of your activity. Blood oxygen sensor The Pixel Watch is also fitted with a blood oxygen sensor, which calculates the oxygen saturation in your blood. This sensor also uses lights to determine how much saturated and unsaturated blood is in your veins and arteries. Whatever the photodiodes in your Pixel Watch read will give you a better idea of how much oxygen is in your blood. Unfortunately, the blood oxygen sensor in the Pixel Watch is inactive at this time. While the sensor has a place on the watch, Google hasn’t made any statements as to when and where this feature would be unlocked for use. While it would be incredibly useful, it just sits inactive on the Pixel Watch for now. Related: Google Pixel Watch review: Expect disappointment, and you’ll never be disappointed Function-based sensors The Pixel Watch has four other sensors besides the one listed already. Those four sensors help with the function of the watch as well as provide additional environmental data for you. Compass The compass might be the most straightforward sensor, as it detects whether or not you’re on the right path and heading the right way. Unfortunately, the Pixel Watch doesn’t have a stock compass app, much like the Appl Watch. Rather, the Pixel Watch uses the compass in Google Maps. Google Maps on the Pixel Watch gives you a nice written view, as well as a top-down live view of your position on the map. Pointing the top of your watch in any direction will reflect on the map, showing you the correct direction. Altimeter Much like the compass, an altimeter measures a factor in your environment. Plainly speaking, it measures how high up you are in relation to sea level. To determine that, the altimeter reads barometric pressure to determine how high up you are. While there’s no app that shows you an outright reading of your elevation, the altimeter is used to determine how many flights of stairs you’ve climbed that day. Gyroscope Much like in a phone, the Pixel Watch’s gyroscope determines the physical orientation of the device. One main area this is used in is with tilt-to-wake on your device. If the feature is enabled, lifting the watch toward your face will usually wake the device. The gyroscope senses that movement and orientation and brightens the display so you can read notifications and the watch face. Ambient light sensor Lastly, the ambient light sensor does exactly what it sounds like – it senses light. This is generally used when your Pixel Watch has the auto brightness feature enabled, allowing the watch to determine how many nits of brightness out of 1,000 it should use. In very bright situations, there’s an extra setting that peaks the brightness so you can see in the brightest conditions. Overall, the Pixel Watch has an abundance of sensors that not only help it track general environmental data but gives you a clear understanding of your health with the help of the Fitbit app. Of course, we’re hoping Google enables the blood oxygen sensor soon so that the Pixel Watch can reach further potential. Even so, the suite of sensors on the wearable is a good start. Buy the Pixel Watch More on the Pixel Watch: Pixel Watch vs. Apple Watch Series 8: Can Google match the gold standard smartwatch?

After collecting Rs. 26.65 crore through the first two days, the film dropped by 30 percent on the third day. According to early estimates. Ram Setu has collected in the range of Rs. 7.60 to 8.20 crore on the third day. There is a drop of 35 percent in the multiplexes, but the mass belts acted as a stabilizer taking the overall drop in the 30 percent range. Ram Setu is dropping post the opening day, but that was expected as the film was released on a Tuesday with mixed reports from critics and audiences alike. Tomorrow - Friday will be the acid test. If Ram Setu drops by 15 to 20 percent on Friday, then it will end its run way under the Rs. 100 crore mark at the box office. Even on the third day, the business benefited due to the Diwali festival holiday in the mass belt. On Friday most states will be out of the festive flavor and hence, it won't be too surprising if there is another drop in numbers. The three-day numbers are low for a festival release featuring a star of Akshay Kumar's calibre. The three-day business for a Diwali release at worst should have been upside of Rs. 45 crore, but Ram Setu has fallen short of expectations. Over the next 3 days, we need to see if Ram Setu can somehow manage to reach around the Rs. 60 crore mark, as that might keep it in the race to hit a century though the trend over the first 3 days suggests a tough path ahead for this Abhishek Sharma directed action adventure.\nbollywoodhungama\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/ramu-setu-box-office-estimate-day-3-drops-by-30-percent-on-day-3-total-st/","tags":[],"title":"Ramu Setu Box Office Estimate Day 3: DROPS by 30 percent on Day 3; total stands low at Rs. 34.50 crores"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"FTCCI hails Thai Airways’ move to resume flights to Hyderabad ‘Passenger, cargo operations to be at pre-COVID level from October 30’\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/ftcci-hails-thai-airways-move-to-resume-flights-to-hyderabad/","tags":[],"title":"FTCCI hails Thai Airways’ move to resume flights to Hyderabad"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Here’s an alternative to Belkin’s awkward Continuity Camera mount for iPhone Apple’s Continuity Camera feature has landed with macOS Ventura and iOS 16 that lets you use your great iPhone camera as your Mac’s webcam.

The agency has proposed rules that would require stricter security for the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and Wireless Emergency Alerts. Participants and telecoms would have to not only report EAS breaches within 72 hours, but provide yearly certifications that they both have \"sufficient\" safeguards and a risk management plan.The proposed rules would also require phone carriers to send authentication data ensuring that only legitimate emergency alerts reach customer devices. The FCC is similarly looking for comments on the effectiveness of the current requirements for transmitting EAS notices, and suggestions for \"alternative approaches\" with improvements.The proposal comes three years after University of Colorado researchers warned that it was easy to spoof FEMA's presidential alerts, with no way to verify the authenticity of the broadcasts. And while the 2018 Hawaii missile alert was the result of an error rather than a hack, it underscored the risks associated with false warnings. Even at small scales, a fake alert could reach tens of thousands of people, possibly leading to panic and reduced trust in real messages.It's not certain if the proposals are enough. The 72-hour window may help prevent some false alerts, but not all of them — that's plenty of time for a hacker to both breach an emergency system and send fake messages. It's likewise unclear if the FCC would update its security requirements to keep up with evolving threats. Even so, this shows that the Commission is at least aware of the dangers.\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/fcc-proposes-rules-to-prevent-fake-emergency-alerts/","tags":["Government Agencies","Government","site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Jon Fingas"],"title":"FCC proposes rules to prevent fake emergency alerts"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"Research opens up new avenues for overcoming treatment resistance in colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers.

As CNBCreports, The New York Post has confirmed it was the victim of a hack. The perpetrators briefly defaced both the newspaper's website and Twitter account with racist and sexist headlines, including ones targeting New York City Mayor Eric Adams and House Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In a statement, the The Post said only that it was \"investigating the cause.\" No one has taken credit for the hack as of this writing, and it's not clear if the intruders took any sensitive data. This isn't the first breach targeting The Post this year. In February, News Corp revealed that hackers compromised email accounts and documents for The Post and Wall Street Journal employees, including some journalists. Mandiant, a security firm working for the media giant, believed China was conducting an intelligence gathering operation. It's not certain if there's any relation between the cyberattacks.The attack comes just weeks after Fast Company fell victim to hacks that let the culprit send racist notifications to Apple News users. The publication went so far as to shut down its entire website while it addressed the incident. The hacker claimed to have exploited weak password security in WordPress that let them steal employee login info, password hashes and draft articles.There's no known link between the hacks at present. However, they illustrate the potential dangers of site violations like this. On top of the risks to data, they provide easy ways for hackers to spread toxic and partisan messages. It won't be surprising if there are similar campaigns in the near future, especially with the US midterm elections just weeks away.\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/the-new-york-post-is-the-latest-news-outlet-to-get-hacked/","tags":["Information Technology","site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Jon Fingas"],"title":"The New York Post is the latest news outlet to get hacked"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Cultural programmes inaugurated thehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/cultural-programmes-inaugurated/","tags":[],"title":"Cultural programmes inaugurated"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"BJP stages demo condemning DMK government thehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/bjp-stages-demo-condemning-dmk-government/","tags":[],"title":"BJP stages demo condemning DMK government"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Adivi Sesh starrer \u0026lsquo;Major\u0026rsquo; chosen for the Indian Panaroma category at IFFI 2022 On the work front, the actor who was last seen in the superhit film 'Major' has multiple projects in hand.

The blur feature is available only on WhatsApp web and allows users to blur some parts of the image before sending. This feature could be useful for office users since they can quickly blur some unwanted parts of the image without having to open any third-party software. The feature is also useful for someone like me who adds stickers on images to hide some parts of the image. Having said that, the feature also sticks to Meta’s policy of privacy as you can keep unwanted things private. With all the use cases of this tool, here’s how you can use the feature. How to use the WhatsApp Blur tool on Desktop Step 1: Open WhatsApp Web or tap on the following link directly web.whatsapp.com. Step 2: Log in to your WhatsApp account by scanning the code. Step 3: Now, WhatsApp for the desktop will be opened which will allow you to chat directly on the choice of your web browser. Tap on the chat you want to send the image to. Step 4: Open the image, by tapping on the attachment button, followed by selecting the photo icon at the bottom (it’s colored in light violet). Step 5: Once you have opened the image and want to blur some part of it, tap on the Blur icon that’s 5th in the row of options above the image. It’s beside the crop icon and next to the pencil icon. Step 6: After you tap on the Blur tool, you should see a blurred box on your image. You can resize it and change its type; there are two types – pixelated blur and gaussian blur. Select the type of blur and resize the blur area as per your wish. Once you are done, you are ready to send your edited image. That’s how easily you can blur some parts of the image on WhatsApp web.

During the 24th match of ICC T20 World Cup 2022 between Pakistan and Zimbabwe in Perth, Zimbabwe beat Pakistan by 1 run to add to the list of upsets in this tournament. Ranked four in MRF Tyres ICC T20I Team Rankings, Pakistan would’ve fancied their chances of treating a 131-run target against the 11th ranked team as a cakewalk on most occasions. However, Babar Azam (4) and his men ended up complicating matters to an unprecedented level. Standing tall on their knack of making life difficult for them unnecessarily, Pakistani batters put on display another such example by faltering at the Perth Stadium after their most trusted pair in openers Mohammad Rizwan (14) and Babar Azam failed thoroughly. Not giving up on the prospect of defending a below par total, Zimbabwean bowlers kept at it to restrict Pakistan to 129/8 in 20 overs. One of their biggest victories in the last two decades or so, it came on the back of a all-encompassing team effort. It was a game-changing 14th over by Zimbabwe all-rounder Sikandar Raza which perhaps brought Zimbabwe into the match for the first time. Raza, who dismissed Pakistan vice-captain Shadab Khan (17) and batter Haider Ali (0) on back-to-back deliveries, won the match award for his bowling figures of 4-0-25-3. Virender Sehwag terms Zimbabwe win vs Pakistan as great revenge for fake Mr Bean Former India batter Virender Sehwag took to social media platform Twitter to add meat to Fake Mr. Bean controversy with respect to this match. Sehwag retweeted a tweet by a Zimbabwean fan which started all this to term their victory over Pakistan as a “great revenge”. “Bhai kya badla le liya teri team ne Fraud Pak Bean ka [Brother, what a revenge has been taken by your team for fraud Pakistani Bean],” Sehwag tweeted.

During the 24th match of the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup 2022 at the Perth Stadium, Zimbabwe have managed to cause a major upset, as they defeat Pakistan in a humdinger of a contest by 1 run, to register only their second victory ever against the Asian nation in this format. En route the rather modest target of 131 runs, Pakistan, akin their previous match against India, got off to a horrid start, losing their dependable opening pair of skipper Babar Azam (4 off 9) and Mohammad Rizwan (14 off 16) within the Powerplay. Despite losing wickets at regular intervals, Babar Azam’s men hardly looked out of the game, requiring mere 38 runs off the final 5 Overs, with five wickets in hand and the well set Shan Masood (44 off 38) at the crease. However, the experienced Zimbabwean allrounder Sikandar Raza (4-0-25-3) turned up with the ball this time around, as he not only caught the big fishes in Shadab Khan (17 off 14) and Haider Ali (0 off 1) off consecutive deliveries earlier during the 14th Over, but also dismissed Masood later to cause panic in the Pakistani camp. Ultimately, with 11 runs required off the last Over, all eyes were on Mohammad Nawaz (22 off 18) to take his team over the line, but with him getting Out on the penultimate delivery, Pakistan managed to score just a single off the final ball, to lose the match by one run. Is Pakistan out of T20 World Cup Losing both their matches in the ongoing World Cup on the final delivery, Pakistan have now slipped down to the fifth spot in the ‘Super 12 Group 2’ points table. Tonight’s loss has meant that Pakistan are all but out of the tournament, as they will not only have to win all their remaining three matches of the ‘Super 12’ stage, but do so convincingly to up their Net run rate (NRR) as well, which post the loss tonight reads -0.050. Moreover, they will also have to expect at least a couple of other results from ‘Group 2’ to go their way as well, just like India had to have their way during the T20 World Cup in UAE last year, when they too had lost both their opening matches against Pakistan and New Zealand.

But it hasn’t taken that much time, since Star Trek’s first animated sitcom very quickly found its feet to become my favorite Trek of the streaming era. The second season showed a growing confidence in its own execution, and as the third season concludes, we find it proud to show the world what it’s now capable of.The clue, really, was in the swift resolution to the Pakled cliffhanger which ended the second year. On one hand, a sitcom like Lower Decks doesn’t need to turn into The Wire to keep you hooked. But it’s also aware that it can sow the seeds of a running plot thread – the story of Rutherford’s implant – into the fabric of so many episodes. And that the payoff was far more interested in the impact on the character than the cliffhanger.And these strands certainly paid off in “Reflections,” which revealed that a person, or persons unknown, were behind Rutherford’s implant. But even that paid off in a way that you weren’t necessarily expecting it to come back here in the two-ish part finale. And who was the big bad of the season, really? Nothing more than the bete noire of so many Golden Era Trek episodes, the Evil Admiral™. I loved the show’s attempted justification for why Starfleet churns out so many of them – the lack of career development pushes people to extremes – too.If there was a sore spot, it was that the penultimate episode, “Trusted Sources” wheeled out the hacky Journalist Makes Everyone Look Awful plot. It’s about as hackneyed as the one where a sitcom character has their boss over for dinner yet accidentally forgets to tell their partner. It’s only really a crowbar to get Mariner pushed out of Starfleet in preparation for the finale, and it never looked like it was going to stick given her obvious love of the Cerritos.Naturally, the season ends with a punch-the-air victory for not just the Cerritos, but the whole California Class. I’ve always loved Lower Decks’ celebration of the painstaking, cautious and fundamentally boring, yet fundamental, work that serving in Starfleet often requires. Its regular rejection of the, uh, more Kurtzmanesque tendencies of the series makes me love it all the more. Because, like science, the best work is often slow, incremental and dull until it marks a fundamental shift in how we understand the universe. And you can’t really do that if you’re spending your whole episode running from an explosion or proving how tough you are.Another sign of the show’s confidence is in its second crew-lite episode (I’m always a fan of a show that’ll take you elsewhere for an episode or two). This time, it was centered on the fate of the evil Exocomp Peanut Hamper, last seen making a run for it in the first season finale. “A Mathematically Perfect Resolution” allowed the show to both flesh out a previously one-note character, and explore a new corner of the Star Trek world.Even better, the sparse opening act offered a lengthy showcase for Chris Westlake’s gorgeous score. Star Trek has always been about its music as much as its narrative, and the show is lucky to have both Westlake and Nami Melumad producing virtuoso work on a weekly basis. I can’t wait for a season three soundtrack album, especially since we once again hear the James Horner-parodying Lower Decks Action Theme several times this year.If I have a concern, it’s that Lower Decks often feels like it’s designed with lasers to milk my nostalgia glands. I’ll often spend a chunk of each episode clapping like a mad seal at the latest Trek deep cut Mike McMahon and Co. throw at viewers each week. The only thing that prevents it from becoming gratuitous fanservice is that these feel mostly earned. And it has been an orgy of references, including an extended visit to Deep Space Nine.My heart can do nothing but swell when Nana Visitor (Kira), Armin Shimmerman (Quark), JG Hertzler (Martok), Susan Gibney (Leah Brahmas) and George Takei (Captain Sulu!). And the show has the appropriate respect for Trek MVP Jeffrey Combs to bring him back for a quick visit to Agimus, still trapped in Starfleet’s filing cabinet for self-aware, megalomaniacal computers. I didn’t even mention the extended First Contact riff, complete with an appearance by James Cromwell, or the riff on classic TNG episode “Symbiosis” with quite possibly the darkest joke ever seen in a Trek series.I’m running out of room to heap the usual praise on the cast, all of whom do sterling work on a regular basis. And that’s before we discuss the glorious, last-minute reveal that T’Lyn, the so-called “emotional” Vulcan from last year’s “wej Duj” has transferred to the Cerritos. (Do I want her to join Beta Shift? I have no idea, but I’m looking forward to seeing how she interacts with the gang now she’s here.)I’m naturally very excited for Lower Decks’ Season 4 but, by my calculations, the next time we’ll see Mariner and Boimler appear in Strange New Worlds. Given that we already know that Tawny Newsome and Jack Quaid look like their characters, I can’t wait to see them appear on the Enterprise bridge and stare lovingly at Pike’s Peak. My favorite nü-Trek series merging with my second-favorite? Be still my beating heart.\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/star-trek-lower-decks-finds-riches-in-its-own-margins/","tags":["Media","Celebrities","Arts \u0026 Entertainment","Television","site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Daniel Cooper"],"title":"‘Star Trek: Lower Decks’ finds riches in its own margins"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Road-cum-rail bridge thrown open for vehicular traffic in Rajamahendravaram thehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/road-cum-rail-bridge-thrown-open-for-vehicular-traffic-in-rajamahendravaram/","tags":[],"title":"Road-cum-rail bridge thrown open for vehicular traffic in Rajamahendravaram"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Researchers design next-generation electrolytes for lithium metal batteries A team of researchers has discovered a new mechanism to stabilize the lithium metal electrode and electrolyte in lithium metal batteries.

Melange did some reading and research to compile a list of health benefits (both physical and psychological) associated with this drink.At the outset, to state the obvious coffee contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that is known for its ability to fight fatigue and increase energy levels. Some research suggests that consuming coffee regularly could be associated with a decreased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes over the long term. This is thought to be due to coffee's ability to preserve the function of the beta cells in the pancreas, which are responsible for producing insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Moreover coffee is rich in antioxidants and may affect insulin sensitivity, inflammation and metabolism — all of which are involved in the development of Type 2 diabetes. Although studies have turned up mixed results, it is believed that coffee may help protect against certain neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that moderate coffee consumption could be associated with a lower risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Some studies have even found that drinking coffee could be associated with a lower risk of depression. This is not all. Several doctors suggest that coffee can support liver health and protect against liver disease. Incidentally a recent study found that coffee consumption was associated with decreased liver stiffness, which is a measure that healthcare professionals use to assess fibrosis; the formation of scar tissue in the liver. Some research shows that drinking coffee may benefit heart health too. However, caffeine can affect blood pressure levels. Therefore, people with unmanaged blood pressure may need to limit or moderate their caffeine intake. So the next time you brew your coffee, do remember these health benefits and smile.Also Read: One Day Internationals in Guwahati: Nostalgic RemembrancesAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/love-coffee-your-favourite-beverage-is-also-fortified-with-health-benefits/","tags":["Life,Melange,Supplements,More"],"title":"Love coffee?

The Umiam Stage-3 is in the final stage and NEEPCO is expected to start the implementation process soon. Both Stage-I and Stage-II would cost around Rs 1,750 crore with 70 per cent loan. Noting that Meghalaya has been facing power deficit of 50 per cent of total demand of electricity during peak hours, Tynsong said that he told the NEEPCO officials and engineers to ensure that the signing of an agreement on Tuesday should not remain in the paper but should be made into a reality at the earliest. He said that the State Government is likely to scrap agreements signed earlier with few more private investors as they failed to execute their commitments.

A complaint was also lodged with the National Commission of Women and the Council of Architecture (COA). General Diary against the alleged professor Inappropriate interactions between the professor and his students in several situations are mentioned in the general diary that has been signed by 35 students. The letter states: “From taking photographs to making inappropriate comments such as how a girl looks and is easily recognisable even from the back, what a girl could do to look more beautiful and even comparing different body measurements of different female students. He has remarked in class about the size of the bed a girl would require with her partner. There were no scenarios that would invite such comments on our female students. He has often told the boys of the class which girl will be better as wife material, and has pointed out how a girl must be judged based on grounds of looks, figures and dress.” The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) of the university had taken up the case and scheduled their first meeting with the students on September 22; however, the students complained of unnecessary delay in the procedure and lackadaisical attitude in the behaviour of the members. “The ICC members need to fast-track this. They only find the opportunity to meet on Thursdays and even on those days so many engagements come up for them. We’ve only had two meetings so far; the others were cancelled for unnecessary reasons. The issue at hand is very serious and such an attitude is, in a way, enabling the behaviour of the offender,” said one of the many students of the Architecture department who spoke to EdexLive on the condition of anonymity. The alleged professor was also listed as the 56th name on the List of Sexual Harassers in Academia (LoSHA) by a student of UC Davis School of Law, Raya Sarkar, on October 24, 2017. Numerous complaints and repeat offender These are also the same complaints that one can find on the Facebook confession page started by these students. The page is called 'It's you Not US' and students have been anonymously submitting their confessions there regarding the unpleasant experiences they had with the professor. The page has over 30 confessions from students across batches. While most of the confessions are about his casual sexism and inappropriate touching, one confession sticks out. A female student from the 2019 batch claims to be harassed on her review day since she wouldn't give him her phone number or go to his room, “He started asking every detail of my drawing and started rebuking me absolutely for no reason. At least two of the boys from my class told sir to leave me as the review was over but sir told them that 'she should know how it feels when one doesn't keep one's word.' So all the harassment was not because my design was bad, it was because I didn't go to his room.” Despite the number of complaints, students claim the professor is still taking classes. “He was requested to not take the classes of just the fifth-year students since we lodged a written complaint against him with the Vice-Chancellor, however, he might start taking our classes again in November,” says a fifth-year student of the Architecture Department. When EdexLive reached out to the Head of the Department, Dr Mainak Ghosh, he refuted the claim saying there has been no such directive. He further added, “Suspension cannot happen unless we get an official directive and we’ve got none so far.” A Postgraduate student from the Architecture Department claims, “They are not suspending him because when they did so previously in a couple of cases, a defamation case was filed against the university.” Additionally, the students also allege that the accused professor and his allies have been harassing a few students. “We have received numerous calls from the professor where he was profusely crying. He also has a lot of power academically and we fear he can get vindictive,” claims one of the students. Another student alleges how the harassment also comes from PhD students and adds, “We get random calls and attempts are made to manipulate us with false threats.” Protests continue; Pro-VC meet students but no response from VC Numerous attempts were made by the students to meet the Vice-Chancellor but their efforts were in vain. “We could only meet the Pro-Vice Chancellor so far and he gave us assurance of an action, but we aren’t too sure,” says one of the students. It was also the Pro-Vice \\-Chancellor and the Joint Registrar who received the official complaint letter written by the students after the students failed to receive any response from the Vice-Chancellor via repeated emails and visits. Students continue to stage protests on the university campus as the ICC continues their slow investigation. The Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students' Union (FETSU), submitted a deputation to the Vice-Chancellor on September 27, however, the students of the Architecture Department claim that they are alone in this fight and barely found any solidarity from their collegemates. “Other departments couldn’t see this as an issue of Jadavpur as a whole, unfortunately,” concludes one of the fifth-year students in despair. edexlive\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/after-jadavpur-universitys-lackadaisical-response-to-sexual-abuse-complain/","tags":[],"title":"After Jadavpur University's lackadaisical response to sexual abuse complaint against professor, students take matter to police"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"\u0026lsquo;Nehru made \u0026lsquo;blunders\u0026rsquo; on Kashmir, Modi corrected them\u0026rsquo;: BJP hits out at Congress Under Article 370, special provisions were also granted to Jammu and Kashmir, which is now a union territory, and the country paid a high price for it, according to Gaurav Bhatia.

The fire broke out at the Naharlagun daily market on Tuesday morning, and shopkeepers claimed that they rushed to an adjacent fire station after spotting the blaze but no personnel was present there. They also alleged that the fire brigade personnel arrived at the spot with fire tenders that were not filled with adequate water. A preliminary inquiry revealed that the officer in-charge and the staff in charge of night duty of the Naharlagun fire station failed to discharge their duties effectively, according to a statement issued by the Directorate of Fire and Emergency Services. The suspension order for the two fire services personnel was issued and a fact-finding exercise is underway, the statement said. The market, the oldest in the State, is situated near the fire station and Naharlagun Police Station, around 14 km from Arunachal Pradesh's capital Itanagar. There was no casualty in the fire that was first spotted around 4 am on Tuesday, they said. Superintendent of Police (Capital) Jimmy Chiram said the exact cause of the fire would be ascertained after completion of an investigation by the fire department. Four fire tenders from Naharlagun and Itanagar along with adequate personnel were engaged in the operation, the official said. Firefighters had faced difficulties due to lack of water-filling facilities at Naharlagun, and the fire tenders were refilled from Lekhi Iron factory, situated around five kilometres from the incident site, according to the statement. \"The State Government has approved two borewells for the fire station and work is likely to start soon,\" it said. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Pema Khandu has assured shopkeepers that all possible support from the State Government would be extended to those who suffered losses due to the fire at the market. A CORRESPONDENT ADDS FROM ITANAGAR: Itanagar Municipal Corporation (IMC) Mayor Tamme Phassang, along with corporators, the IMC Commissioner and other officials visited the Naharlagun daily market fire site and also interacted with the victims. The Mayor informed that details of the unfortunate incident have been apprised to the top official, and even the Chief Minister himself has expressed concern about the incident. The purpose of today's visit was to take stock of the situation and to get first-hand information from the victim themselves so that every victim would get an equal platform to express grievances. Phassang also assured us to extend all possible help to the victims. \"We are also holding meetings related to the unfortunate incident so that immediate help would be provided to the victims,\" he said.

It's been more than a month since the fee hike issue intensified and seems like there is no conclusion yet. The issue started when the university announced a 300-400% hike in fees for new students. This move was criticised by the current batches. They staged huge protests, a few students even tried self-immolating and more. Although a lot has been happening, seems like the University hasn't taken a call on what to do. When EdexLive spoke to students of Allahabad University, a Commerce PhD scholar, Shristi Singh, highlighted the issue saying students from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and so on join the varsity as good quality education is given at a very reasonable cost. \"The students are not opting for Delhi University or any such other universities because they can't afford it,\" she stressed. Worst effect on girl students... Shriti sharing her personal experience stresses that with the fee hike, the worst effect will be on girl students. \"For example, in my case, because I studied in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya from Class VI to XII where free education is given, now I am able to afford higher studies. But in my sister's case, it was different. She couldn't get the education I received.\" We proceeded to ask what made her think that the fee hike will have the worst impact on girl students? She replies, \"If a family has both a son and a girl, with high fees how will they manage to allow both to pursue education? As per societal norms, the first preference in education is given to boys. Therefore, female students stand to lose more.\" Trouble for next generation Similarly, another postgraduate (PG) student Satyam Kushwana, who is pursuing his MA in Philosophy said, \"Along with hike in fee, other expenses like accommodation rent, food and transport will be pressuring for students.\" But how is it trouble for the coming generations? Satyam explains that his brother wanted to join the same college. But now with an increase in fee, he will not be joining. Coming from a kisan (farmer's) family, the resident of Rewa, Madhya Pradesh says, \"Even if I want to pursue my higher studies in the same university, I won't be able to continue due to the fee hike.\" What next? Right now, students said that the college is closed owing to Dussehra and Diwali holidays. It will open after the Chhath Puja holidays, probably in the first week of November. So students are planning to fight again in a bigger way this time. Although the fee hike is not applicable to the current students, they are concerned about their future education. Sharing details of the protest, the Allahabad University Students' Union (AUSU) President and the National Students' Union of India (NSUI) State President Akhilesh Yadav said, \"We are seeking the support of Banaras Hindu University and Delhi University. Jawaharlal Nehru University has already extended its support. So, once the university reopens, we will stage a bigger protest.\" Recalling the self-immolation incident, Akhilesh said, \"That time when we met the City Magistrate, Inspector-General of Police, District Magistrate and Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), the police told us to continue the Andolan without involving any himsa (violence).\" EdexLive tried reaching out to the University's Dean of Student Welfare, but there was no response. edexlive\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/allahabad-university-students-point-out-what-freshers-stand-to-lose-if-300/","tags":[],"title":"Allahabad University: Students point out what freshers stand to lose if 300% fee hike is not withdrawn"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"A Woman Dedicated to Music, Verse and Prose Maitrayee Patar, who is hailed among the rising stars of the music industry of Assam, is also a prolific poet and writer. SATURDAY FARE caught up with this charismatic young lady to understand her thoughts and life philosophy\nMy biggest and most important inspiration has been Mother Nature. I feel an intense bond with her. I feel that she possesses the answers to all of my questions, even the ones that have never been asked. 'Whenever in doubt, turn to Nature' has been my motto since always. Nature humbles me, keeps me rooted and inspires me to create without asking for anything in return- Maitrayee PatarMaitrayee Patar, a musical artist who is best known for her work in new-age music has become a household name in our state (and even the north eastern region) in recent years. Despite her stellar achievements, she is a grounded woman. In an exclusive interview to Saturday Fare, Maitrayee reveals several interesting facets about her life and shares her life philosophy. Recounting her journey as a singer, Maitrayee Patar says, \"I have always had my heart for music from as far as I can remember. I was introduced to formal training at the age of 5 when I was fortunate to train under the able guidance of my guru Dr. Ranu Baishya, a very well-known and loved vocalist of her times. I received sincere and intense training in Indian classical music for ten years and that has been the foundation of everything I have ever learnt about music so far. However, I have always been a learner. I like to learn. I feel there is a lot to see, learn and reflect upon and I try to do a little bit of each everyday. This habit has enriched me both as a musician and as a writer.\" Well the charismatic Maitrayee Patar is also a writer. In her words, \"I have been writing poetry for more than a decade now and fortunately have been published in a few really important spaces across the world.\" So what have been the significant milestones and challenges of her life? \"I think it is a tad too early for any milestone but there definitely have been some very special moments and extraordinary experiences in my journey as a writer and as an artist,\" she states matter of factly. Recounting her special moments and treasured and extraordinary experiences, Maitrayee elaborates, \"The release of my first book of poetry 'Mor Kolmou Dinor Xonaali Baat' in 2015 was one such moment. It was the formal beginning of my journey as a writer. In 2017, I got an invitation for the first time by Sahitya Akademi as the youngest poet to read in the 'North-eastern and Southern Writers Meet' held at Vijayawada. I remember running to my mother with the letter in my hand. It was an overwhelming moment for me. In 2019, I was invited as a resident poet to the very prestigious Indo-German writers exchange programme 'Poets Translating Poets' hosted by Goethe Institute, Mumbai.\" She shares that as a young poet, she cherishes the three days that she spent in the lush greenery of Meghalaya with eminent writers and translators from Germany and India. \"My second anthology 'Dingit Goja Paanit Mongoh' came out in 2021 and was well-received both among serious readers of poetry and fans of music. The book is now out in its second edition. However, my fondest and most recent memory as a writer is of meeting Gulzar Sahab and taking his blessings in Shimla, where we both were present as invitees in the coveted International Literature Festival organised by Sahitya Akademi in June this year,\" Maitrayee states and goes on to add, \" Similarly in terms of music, conceiving my debut music album 'Project Baartalaap' in 2017 with my friend Shankuraj Konwar while we were still students in TISS, Mumbai was a life-changing experience for me. It finally hit me that music is actually going to be my connecting thread with the world, apart from poetry. Before that music used to be something really personal for me. By then I had completed my Masters in Sociology from the prestigious Delhi School of Economics and was pursuing M.Phil in Women's Studies from TISS. With a clear inclination towards academics, I never thought of music as a career option. In 2019, 'Duur Ximonat', a song from the same album made it to the Rolling Stone magazine. This was a defining moment for my career. Then eventually 'Baartalaap', 'Alakananda', 'Moupiya', 'Unnaxi', 'Awjana' happened. We also did a few amazing live concerts in a very short span of time. I still fondly remember the crazy crowd of around 15000 vibing to our music at the last Falcon Festival in the hills of Dima Hasao. We have also performed live a couple of times in New Delhi where I saw how music transcends language. All our songs were in Axomiya, but people vibed to our music nonetheless. The way people have loved my songs, my lyrics is itself a lifetime inspiration and motivation to keep going forward. At the same time it also makes me a lot more responsible towards my craft. I am immensely grateful for the journey.\" Maitrayee confesses that finding a fine balance between music, poetry and academics has been challenging for her as all of these areas required her undivided attention and time. \"Being a woman does not make it any easier. However, the immense love and critical appreciation that I have received from known and unknown readers/audience makes me face all the challenges and difficulties associated with it with a smile. I think that in the end, it will all be worth the pain,\" she reasons. Maitrayee Patar is known for her stage presence. When Saturday Fare asked her about the nuances of cultivating this vital aspect, she humbly replies, \"I would take that as a compliment because as an introverted child, I had always been terrified of the stage. I remember admiring the perfection that my idols brought on to the stage, be it in music or in speech. It took me a while to figure out that presence actually means nothing other than simply being present. Realising that I actually have nothing to lose up there as I know almost nothing and that I am only here to learn and share helped me loosen up. In other words, the fact that I can only be as imperfect as anyone else on the other side makes it easier for me to truly connect with the audience/readers.\" Talking about her upcoming ventures and the most significant ventures, she states, \"Well I am fortunate enough to be doing what I love. I am pursuing my passion as a profession. One of my most adventurous work was writing the song 'Nilanjana', which was an ambitious art-collaboration between Project Baartalaap and national award winning filmmaker duo Judhajit Bagchi and Ranadeep Bhattacharya, featuring Brazilian and Spanish artiste duo Aagatha Figueroa and Julio Padial. The challenge was to aesthetically express the explicit sensuality rendered in the song. The song did receive interesting critical reviews from listeners, many of whom said that they were reminded of 'Bimurto mur nixaati' by Dr. Bhupen Hazarika, the stalwart of modern Axomiya music.\" About upcoming ventures, Maitrayee stated that she cannot reveal much at the moment. \"However, I can share that my friend and I have just finished a very interesting piece of music for an internationally acclaimed filmmaker from Assam. It is a privilege to be associated with a project as interesting as this. We are also coming up with a very special musical tribute to the Gnanpith awardee of 2020, eminent poet, our very own Nilamani Phukan on the occasion of his 90th birthday where we have musically interpreted one of his famous poems. I have always seen and understood music and poetry as two sides of the same coin. As Phukan Sir also affirms, a good piece of music hides poetry in it and a good poem inevitably has a kind of music to it. Apart from that, I have a few very interesting collaborations lined up. A passion-collaboration in the Mising language is set to release soon. My debut Hindi EP is also in progress.\" Maitrayee states that she is happy seeing the growing love for independent music in Assam. \"We have seen some of the best minds in music in recent times and I am happy to be creating with some of them,\" she shares. Talking about her family, childhood, mentors and inspirations, she says, \"My family has been the foundation to what I am today. My parents were first generation job-holders and also first generation settlers in Guwahati. Our childhood was not that of abundance but it definitely was of fulfillment. Both my parents shared a beautiful, melancholic love for music and literature. They were also the first ones to introduce me to the world of songs and stories and shaped a lot of my sensibilities, towards ourselves and towards the world. For instance I remember Ma often using lines from the songs of the likes of Bhupen Hazarika, Birendranath Dutta, Jayanta Hazarika and Parbeen Sultana to converse with us. It was fun to sometimes discover her singing 'kote kena laagile koboke nuwarilu' from the kitchen when she needed to pacify us. They also always tried to keep me close to nature and urged me to remain human at all times. My parents also taught me to gracefully accept any kind of loss.\" Maitrayee observes that hence a lot of her songs and poems are dipped in an inherent humaneness, a desire to be close to nature and humans. \"Growing up, I have been really fortunate to meet a few personalities who have been my kind inspiration and mentors. However, my biggest and most important inspiration has been Mother Nature. I feel an intense bond with her. I feel that she possesses the answers to all of my questions, even the ones that have never been asked. 'Whenever in doubt, turn to Nature' has been my motto since always. Nature humbles me, keeps me rooted and inspires me to create without asking for anything in return,\" she concludes philosophically.Also Read: Think Creative and Get a Better Grip on LifeAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/a-woman-dedicated-to-music-verse-and-prose/","tags":["Life,Saturday Fare,Supplements,More"],"title":"A Woman Dedicated to Music, Verse and Prose"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Kerala government mulling legal options to remove Governor as Chancellor of State-run Universities The State government is closely looking at the Bill passed by the West Bengal government in June to make the Chief Minister as Chancellor of State Universities.\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/kerala-government-mulling-legal-options-to-remove-governor-as-chancellor-of/","tags":[],"title":"Kerala government mulling legal options to remove Governor as Chancellor of State-run Universities"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"‘When Chai Met Toast’ releases a minute-long song Lovin’ U When Chai Met Toast’s new minute-long song has hints hidden in it as to what the band is up to next ‘Lovin’ U’ is that cute little song you can’t really get enough of!

Batting first, India was off to a shaky start as they lost opener KL Rahul for 9 off 12 balls after a medium pacer Paul van Meekeren trapped his leg before the wicket. India was 11/1 in 2.4 overs. Star batter Virat Kohli joined Rohit Sharma on the crease in the third over. The duo took India through the powerplay safely, without any further fall of a wicket. However, the Netherlands kept Indian batters subdued with their great line and length. At the end of six overs, India was at 32/1, with Kohli (6*) and Rohit (16*) at the crease. Both batters did hit some big shots, but they struggled to connect properly and big outfields forced them to satisfy themselves with doubles. The duo brought up their 50-run stand in 41 balls, surviving many mistimed hits and catch attempts. At the end of 10 overs, India was at a decent 67/1, with Rohit (42*) and Kohli (14*). They needed to push their inning into the next gear now. Rohit Sharma brought up his half-century in 35 balls with a four, his 29th in the format. Kohli on the other hand still could not score a boundary. The 75-run stand between the duo was broken after Rohit was caught by Colin Ackermann at deep-midwicket on a delivery by medium pacer Fred Klassen. The skipper scored 53 off 39 balls with four boundaries and three sixes. Suryakumar Yadav joined Kohli on the crease and the latter also broke his boundary drought with a straight four over the bowler’s head. A four by Suryakumar took India to the 100-run mark in 13.2 overs. Suryakumar kept showing his impressive range of shots, helping Men in Blue reach 114/2 in 15 overs, with Kohli (32*) and Suryakumar (17*). The 16th over was good for India as it gave them 14 runs. In the next over, Virat also hit some attractive shots to bring up his second straight fifty in the tournament in just 36 balls, which was also his 35th in the format. The 17th over gave away 16 runs. A boundary from Suryakumar helped India cross the 150-run mark in 17.5 overs. Suryakumar and Virat kept on piling runs, helping India finish at 179/2 in 20 overs. Suryakumar brought his fifty with six on the last ball. Virat finished with 62* off 44 balls with three boundaries and two sixes while Suryakumar finished with 51* off 25 balls with seven fours and a six. The duo formed an unbeaten 95-run stand in 48 balls. Fred Klaassen and Paul van Meekeran took a wicket each for Dutch. Brief Scores: India: 179/2 (Virat Kohli 62*, Rohit Sharma 53, Paul van Meekeran 1/32).

The allegation was made by Minister for General Education and Labour in Kerala, V Sivankutty, on Facebook, saying the impacted employees came to meet him and discuss the issue. “At Technopark, Thiruvananthapuram Employees of Baiju’s app came and met me with the office bearers of IT employees welfare organisation Echo of Technopark. Employees have many complaints including job losses. The Labor Department will conduct a serious inspection in this matter,” the Kerala minister wrote in a post in Malayalam on Facebook. Over 170 employees, who were staffed at Byju’s Technopark office, met the minister on Tuesday, October 25 to seek compensation and pending salaries, according to the post. While the minister did not say anything about the layoffs, Technopark Today, which is a community media platform for employees working at Technopark, wrote on Facebook, saying that Byju’s management forced employees to resign. However, after the incident came into the spotlight, the edtech firm seems to have changed its decision about the layoffs. Byju’s is now offering impacted employees of the Technopark office an option to transfer to offices in other locations, according to a report by The News Minute. According to one of the employees who spoke with the publication, the human resource department of Byju’s began “pressuring employees to resign” after confirming the Technopark office was shutting down. “They called each of us for an exit meeting individually last Friday and demanded our resignation. They also threatened to fire us if we did not resign,” the employee was quoted as saying. But after the minister highlighted the issue on Facebook, Byju’s is said to have sent employees a “reconciliatory” email, telling them that the office has decided to accommodate the entire team working at the Thiruvananthapuram office into the Bengaluru office. The email assured employees that while the Kerala office was shutting down as part of Byju’s efforts to “realign its resources,” the jobs of the employees working there were secure. Impacted employees must join the Bengaluru team by December 1 to resume their current roles in the company, Byju’s chief content officer Vinay Ravindra reportedly said in the mail titled ‘Relocation Opportunity for Team TVM \u0026 Other Benefits’. Those unwilling to relocate “will get a progressive exit package,” said Ravindra in his email, the screenshot of which is attached to the report by The News Minute. The package comes with a six-month extension of health insurance for the employee and their family, a “fast-track” full-and-final settlement, the provision of ‘garden leave’, which is a paid leave given to an employee to look for a next job, and outplacement aid.

But this time, many California residents, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, received an early warning of an earthquake hitting San Jose.\nRepresentative imageRepresentative image\"You may have felt shaking,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai and several California residents on Tuesday received this alert as a 4.8-magnitude earthquake hit the San Francisco Bay Area in the US. But what caught all the concentration and generated some stir on social networks was that many users received the alert even before the area in which they suffered the tremors and shakes of the seismic waves.The mobile alert about the California earthquake was from an app called ShakeAlert, which was developed by Google. Sundar Pichai was one of the thousands of Android phone users who received the alert before the area was hit by tremors. He even shared a screenshot of the Android alert on Twitter and wrote, \"The alert came just before, felt like a long one, hope everyone is ok.\"The alert came just before, felt like a long one, hope everyone is ok pic.twitter.com/mUzLFkkWxz— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) October 25, 2022 Notably, the app does not predict natural disasters but instead analyzes data provided by state government agencies and third parties. The tectonic waves in the earth's crust are always in motion, and when they collide, they generate seismic waves. Sensors installed by the agencies record the data and send it to data processing centres. When recorded waves are high, and damage is expected, the ShakeAlert system reads the information and then sends a notification to alert people.Interestingly, what happens with these apps is that they can record the information and transmit it to other places close to the speed of light, which is faster than the speed at which seismic waves travel. The result is that people are often given an earthquake warning seconds, sometimes even minutes, before the ground beneath their feet actually shakes.\"Light is faster than seismic waves... seismic waves travel at a speed of around 7km per second. This is a rough calculation, so there could be some plus or minus here and there. Now the distance between Delhi and Kolkata is 1,305 kilometers by air. Dividing this number gives us around 190 seconds. So the first tweets on Kolkata tremors came around 7:27 pm. The Delhi tweets came around 3 minutes later.\"\nthehansindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/sundar-pichai-received-an-early-warning-of-an-earthquake-hitting-san-jose/","tags":["Tech,Tech News"],"title":"Sundar Pichai received an early warning of an earthquake hitting San Jose"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Facebook selects 15 Indian online communities for accelerator programme These community leaders will also get an opportunity to collaborate with advocates and other leaders in the community-building ecosystem to bring their ideas to life\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/facebook-selects-15-indian-online-communities-for-accelerator-programme/","tags":[],"title":"Facebook selects 15 Indian online communities for accelerator programme"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"SoftBank-backed tech unicorn Kavak expands in Middle East Kavak plans to invest $130 million over the next two years in the three Middle-Eastern countries, which are set to represent 7-10% of its business.\ncarandbike\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/softbank-backed-tech-unicorn-kavak-expands-in-middle-east/","tags":[],"title":"SoftBank-backed tech unicorn Kavak expands in Middle East"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowls joint-highest number of maidens in T20Is, joins Bumrah Bhuvneshwar achieved the mark with two back-to-back maidens while opening the bowling for India in the 2022 T20 World Cup Super 12 match against the Netherlands in Sydney on Thursday.\nsportstar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/bhuvneshwar-kumar-bowls-joint-highest-number-of-maidens-in-t20is-joins-bum/","tags":[],"title":"Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowls joint-highest number of maidens in T20Is, joins Bumrah"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Police file a complaint against distributors of Liger by Puri Jagannadh Puri Jagannadh directed Liger, which starred Vijay Deverakonda and Ananya Panday in prominent parts.

Former India captain stemmed the wicket flow with a 113-run stand with Hardik Pandya before helping take 48 off the last three overs to seal the game. Hardik, who contributed by scoring 40 with the bat and took three wickets, maintained his spot at No. 3 in the all rounders' list. Meanwhile, Pakistan opener Mohammad Rizwan remains on top of the batter list, but there is a new challenger to the title as New Zealand opener Devon Conway rises three places to second following his unbeaten 92 against Australia at the T20 World Cup. Conway flayed the Australian attack to all parts of the SCG during his 58-ball innings as he and Finn Allen (42 off 16) combined to put the reigning T20 World Cup champions to the sword in the first match of the Super 12s on Saturday. The innings sees Conway jump past India's Suryakumar Yadav (828), Pakistan skipper Babar Azam ((799) and South Africa veteran Aiden Markram ((762) and within striking distance to challenge Rizwan for top billing at a career high rating of 831 rating points. Allen too is on the move, with his swashbuckling knock against the Aussies helping him improve a whopping 17 places to equal 13th overall on the list for batters. On the other hand, Afghanistan's Rashid Khan has overtaken Australia's Josh Hazlewood to become No. 1 among the bowlers.

The sedentary lifestyle is to several diseases like type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome and so on. Every person is so entangled in their work and responsibilities that finding some time for physical activity seems difficult. High ambitions, debts and financial needs, pending work, and preparing for examinations keep people in chains and everything else seems like a waste of time. Some are addicted to mobile phones and live in a virtual world unaware of their body and the Universe they are living in. Many people live in the tiny cocoon they have created for themselves with all the luxuries which leave little scope for any physical activities. Even to go to nearby markets people need vehicles. For some, this has become a status symbol and they can't afford to look small.But this artificial and luxurious lifestyle is causing great damage to the health of people as the efficiency of a body part increases by its usage. So, due to inadequate physical activity people are becoming weaker and less tolerant of physical stress. The muscle tone is lost and the body shape distorts. The joints become stiff and stamina is diminished. Due to less exposure to sunlight people are becoming vitamin D deficient which is important for many vital functions of the body. By inculcating physical activity in our daily routine, we can stay fit and healthy. This can be outdoor brisk walking, running, swimming, playing some outdoor sports, dancing, martial arts, yoga or any physical activity we like. Doing daily household chores also keeps one active, like cleaning the rooms and surroundings, washing clothes and dishes, washing vehicles, bringing groceries and vegetables from the nearby market by walking etc. Those who use public transport can walk for a kilometre every day to the next bus stop while going to the office and can get down at a bus stop prior to their home while returning back. While studying or doing some work by sitting for a long time one should remember to move and stretch their body in between. Physical activity enhances the circulation in our body and every cell of every organ of the body receives an adequate supply of blood to function effectively. The blood carries nutrients and oxygen to the cells of the organs which are also enhanced by physical activity. When we do physical activity, our breathing becomes fast and we inhale more oxygen and liberate latent gases from the lungs. Physical activity also enhances the movement of food in the gastrointestinal tract and helps in proper digestion, absorption, assimilation and excretion of by-products. When metabolism is increased, the enzymes, hormones and other biochemicals in the body are secreted properly bringing the whole body in balance. Outdoor activity or activities in the natural environment will give the best result as the air will be fresh and the mind will be less distracted and our soul feels expanded in open spaces. Stretching exercises and yoga asanas keep the joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments flexible and our body remains fit to do different physical activities with ease. Deep breathing exercises and pranayama are beneficial as it supplies the body with adequate oxygen and saves the organs from hypoxia and degeneration. Movement is our natural character so we should not forget to move. 1. Meditation: Meditation means detaching from everything for some time and reposing in the self. Our lives have become so hectic that we feel 24 hours is less for us to complete our daily work. We have been following the same routine and staying busy always yet there might be very little or no improvement in our lives. We try to control everything and everyone or think we are responsible for all. But do we have control over our own bodies and mind? Are we taking own responsibility? When we will be stable and fit, we can take proper care of others and do our work better. So, giving some time to the self every day or at regular intervals is essential. During this time, we should sit in a peaceful place away from all distractions. It is better if the place is clean, calm and dark. Then we should detach ourselves from our desires, responsibilities and ego for some time. Focus on our heartbeat, breathing pattern, different organs in the body and different body parts. We are alive and capable of doing our daily activities due to homeostasis in the body and because our body parts are fine. We should be grateful for it and take proper care of each part and organ in the body. We need to think that we are a part of the vast universe and not limited to limited space and identity. We are in the Universe and the Universe is within us. The Universal energies are being showered on everyone equally. It is due to the barriers we have created and lack of awareness, we don't receive them. So, we should remove all the negativity we have accumulated on and around us to receive blessings. When we detach from our monotonous thoughts and influences of external factors and illusions material world, we reach our pure core. The core is the soul which is pure and strong. It observes everything but is untouched by anything. Similarly, the soul of every other individual is pure. We should object to mischief and guide the person to become better. People act and behave as per the influences and experiences of the world on them. By changing their perspective anyone can improve themselves. When we see every soul as similar, we feel connected with everyone and as one family. Then there is no bias or prejudice in our minds. After meditation our mind becomes calm and we develop clarity. Our doubts are decreased, and we understand what is right and important. Then our concentration and precision in activities increase. It helps us find answers we have been searching for for a long time. 1. Mindfulness: Being mindful means being aware of the time, space, environment, circumstance and self – to do everything consciously maintaining harmony with the Universe and its components. First of all, we need to become conscious of our body, mind and soul. Then we should act, talk and think for the welfare of all. We need to be mindful of every system of our body. We need to eat consciously at the proper time and food which are fresh, pure and full of essential nutrients as per the requirement of our body. Next, we should sleep at the proper time and adequately so that our circadian cycle is not altered. Our body needs to rest and recharge to function at an optimal level. Secretions of hormones, enzymes and different biochemicals in our body depend on the circadian cycle. If it is disturbed, different systems of the body are disturbed resulting in different diseases. So, sleeping at a fixed time and waking at a fixed time is essential. On average 6-8 hours of sleep is adequate for healthy adults. This may vary according to age and conditions. Then, having a disciplined lifestyle is important to keep the body, mind and soul stable. We need to have personal hygiene, and cleanliness in our clothes, living space and surrounding. Our thoughts and words should also be clean. We should avoid negative thoughts and words. Have faith, patience and work sincerely. We should be honest, confident and clear while communicating. We need to stay presentable so that we don't hesitate to go in front of people or don't feel shy when someone approaches. Our body language expresses a lot about our personality. We should be genuine, have good intentions and do the right thing. We should not get overwhelmed by any event that occurs in our life whether positive or negative. Our emotions and thoughts are temporary and get away with time. Equanimity is necessary. We should respond consciously instead of reacting impulsively. We should not keep our minds stressed over petty things and by involving in unnecessary conflicts with our fellow beings. In the end, nothing matters. We need to stay conscious of the truth. Our time in this world is limited and nothing is permanent. We have to play our roles and complete our journey in a memorable way. Everyone is fighting their own battles for survival and evolution. Everyone is mortal and life is full of miseries. So, we need to be compassionate towards other living beings. We should not hurt others through our actions, words and thoughts due to selfish reasons. We should not remain resentful about the past or worried about the future but we should live in the present moment fully. We should find our strengths and potential and utilize them to the maximum for the welfare of every living being. We should become an asset for our family and society rather than a liability. When we become optimistic and full of energy, we radiate positivity and attract positivity. The whole Universe is a playfield of energies. We absorb energy, utilize it and then radiate it back. As per the law of thermodynamics, energy can neither be created nor destroyed but is transformed from one form to another. So, we should discard negative energies and prepare ourselves to absorb positive energy from everywhere. We should find out the obstructions blocking the energies from reaching us and conserve as much energy as we can. We should discard the distraction that drains our productive energies from us. Only an energetic person can work with concentration and at an optimal level. Energy management is very important along with time management. What not to do is as much important as what to do. We should reduce the intake of sugar, salt, refined oils and flour. We should avoid addictions of all kinds. We should not be unable to live without a particular thing or person. We should have the strong willpower to win over compulsions such as substance abuse, sexual perversions, and sadistic pleasures. We should not be judgemental, sarcastic or insult someone. We should avoid conflicts because friction erodes both surfaces. Unhealthy competition, comparison and challenges take away our peace of mind and compel us to take a different path. We start to become like the person we are thinking always and deviate from our true being. We all are unique and special in our own way. We should be the best version of ourselves not the copy of someone else. We need to bring out our best rather than follow the crowd. We should walk on the right path and set the right trend even if we have to struggle and stay alone for some time. Eventually, people will recognise us and join together. The world is for every living being. So, we should be judicious about their life as well. We should live connected with nature and protect its integrity. We need to conserve soil, water, forests and wildlife. Keep the air pure by reducing pollution and using renewable sources of energy. Nature can protect us as well as destroy us. So, we need to live in harmony and maintain balance in the ecosystem. If we live consciously, we can live healthy, happy and peaceful. Music: Music is used for every activity that relaxes our minds and lifts our spirits. It is very necessary to take life lightly at regular intervals. Always staying alert or stressed has a bad impact on our body, mind and soul. We should not be busy all the time doing something or the other. Despite all the responsibilities, we should have some time for ourselves to recreate and rejuvenate. Only when are relaxed, fit and energetic, we will be able to perform better and love life. Otherwise, most people are repeating monotonous life and are burnt out. Our targets and desires never cease. After achieving one goal we set another. Soon the time slips out of our hands and we can't realize that while preparing to live better we missed all the opportunities to live fully. So, keeping all the worries and stress aside we should make our minds free from every thought and just be present at the moment sometimes. We should get bored of doing nothing sometimes. Only when our mind becomes empty and without any preoccupation, then new out-of-box ideas be generated. Music, arts, hobbies, gardening, fishing or other light sports, nature walking, travelling and adventures, reading what we like, writing our thoughts, learning a new skill, enjoying sports, movies or series on television or any other activity which takes our mind away from stress is necessary occasionally. Living in our little cocoon and thinking about the same thing anytime makes us sick. So, it is necessary to break the chain of monotonous thoughts and engage in some recreational activities. Life is not an emergency but it should be lived to the fullest. Love self and love life. We can do anything if we are alive and fit. So, despite all the work and responsibilities we need to take care of ourselves always.\nsentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/4-ms-for-a-magical-life/","tags":["Editorial,More"],"title":"4 M's for a magical life"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Sardar box office collection day 6: Karthi’s film heads towards Rs 75 cr mark, sprints ahead of Sivakarthikeyan’s Prince indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/sardar-box-office-collection-day-6-karthis-film-heads-towards-rs-75-cr-/","tags":["Entertainment","Tamil"],"title":"Sardar box office collection day 6: Karthi’s film heads towards Rs 75 cr mark, sprints ahead of Sivakarthikeyan’s Prince"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"It\u0026rsquo;s lovely to play with him: Manchester United\u0026rsquo;s Eriksen on partnership with Casemiro It's lovely to play with him: Manchester United's Eriksen on partnership with Casemiro\nindiatoday\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/its-lovely-to-play-with-him-manchester-uniteds-eriksen-on-partnership-wi/","tags":[],"title":"It's lovely to play with him: Manchester United's Eriksen on partnership with Casemiro"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Asia-Pacific faces huge 2.16 mn cybersecurity workforce shortage The size of the global cybersecurity workforce is currently at 4.7 million people. However, the cybersecurity field is still critically in need of more professionals\nNEW DELHI: Despite adding more than 4,64,000 workers in the past year, the cybersecurity workforce gap has grown more than twice, and in the Asia-Pacific region, the shortage exceeds 2.16 million, putting organisation at a \"moderate\" to \"extreme\" risk of cyber attacks, a new report has revealed.The size of the global cybersecurity workforce is currently at 4.7 million people. However, the cybersecurity field is still critically in need of more professionals, according to the 2022 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study. \"To adequately protect cross-industrial enterprises from increasingly complex modern threats, organisations are trying to fill the worldwide gap of 3.4 million cybersecurity workers,\" the findings showed. The report surveyed 11,779 international practitioners and decision-makers to gain their unique perspectives and experiences about working in the modern cybersecurity profession. While the global cybersecurity workforce grew 11.1 per cent year-on-year, adding 464,000 roles in 2022. Asia-Pacific clocked the highest growth at 15.6 per cent, while EMEA's workforce expanded by 12.5 per cent. North America, which saw the least growth (6.2 per cent), still has the largest pool of cybersecurity professionals at 1.34 million. \"The workforce gap is not going unnoticed by cybersecurity workers as nearly 70 per cent feel their organisation does not have enough cybersecurity staff to be effective. The shortage is particularly severe in aerospace, government, education, insurance and transportation,\" said the study. More than half of employees at organisations with workforce shortages feel that staff deficits put their organisation at a \"moderate\" or \"extreme\" risk of cyberattack. And that risk increases substantially when organisations have a significant staffing shortage.

The language, adopted as a medium of instruction, is instrumental in triggering the holistic development of the child. In the context of India, it is a difficult task to choose a particular language for that purpose due to the multilingual character of Indian society. Multilingualism is an important dimension of our composite culture. There are hundreds of languages in the country and 22 constitutionally recognized languages. The National Education Policy of India 2020 (NEP 2020), designed by the K Kasturirangan Committee, appears to have considered such issues seriously and pragmatically and articulates some novel ideas regarding language teaching. An important object behind the new policy is to make the learners aware of the rich cultural heritage of the nation and to promote multilingualism as well as national unity. But there are potential challenges in the implementation of such proposals as textbooks are scarce, experienced and skilled language teachers etc.The Policy recognizes that the knowledge of the rich diversity of India should be imbibed first-hand by learners. India is a country of multiculturalism, and it is a national responsibility to preserve the essence of Indian culture and to retain that for future generations. Diversity is felt everywhere from language to food habits, from music, and dance to architecture. In a vast country like India, it is a challenge to insulate the multicultural ethos against parochial interests and regional diversities. The National Education Policy (NEP), approved by the Union Cabinet on 29th July 2020 is supposed to introduce a sea of changes in the Indian education system, thereby replacing the 1986 Policy on Education. In the NEP it is clearly stated that language is to be used as a potential tool for furthering the multiculturalism of India and familiarizing the learners with the ethos of our cultural diversity. Additionally, it may be optimally used in enhancing professional efficiency in more than one language for pursuing various careers in the present context of globalization, the confluence of diverse cultures and the emergence of numerous multinational companies expanding their activities to the nook and cranny of the country. It is apprehensible even from a cursory look that the language policy for NEP 2020 is adopted intricately to harness the efficacy of language for furthering the multicultural ethos of the country, besides the development of proficiency in the languages integrated into the curriculum. The NEP-2020 considers India as a treasure trove of culture, developed over thousands of years and manifested in the form of arts, works of literature, customs, traditions, linguistic expressions, artefacts, heritage sites, and many more. It suggests that the preservation and promotion of India's cultural wealth must be considered a high priority for the country, as it is truly important for the nation's identity as well as for its economy. Language, of course, is inextricably linked to art and culture. Art, which is available in the form of literature, plays, music, film, etc., cannot be fully appreciated without language, and naturally, to preserve and promote culture, we must preserve and promote our languages. Unfortunately, Indian languages have not received their due attention and care, and the drafting committee expresses concern over the extinction of over 220 Indian languages and dialects in the last 50 years alone, while UNESCO has declared another 197 Indian languages as 'endangered '. For preserving the multicultural ethos of the country NEP2020 adopts a language policy where it puts a remarkable thrust on a whole array of languages to be integrated into the curriculum at school and higher education. For cultural enrichment as well as national integration, all young Indians should be aware of the rich linguistic diversity of the land and the treasures that our languages contain. Therefore, the NEP-2020 recommends that all students will learn three languages in their school under the three-language formula. The choice of languages learnt will depend on the state and the students, although at least two of the three languages must be native to the country – one of which is most likely to be the local/regional language. As the policy states under the section called 'multilingualism, and power of language', \"wherever possible, the medium of instruction until at least Class 5, but preferably till Class 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language.\" Considering the serious difficulties faced by the languages on many fronts the NEP-2020 recommends the integration of Indian languages into school and higher education at every level. It suggests initiatives for ensuring high-quality learning and print materials in these languages, including textbooks, workbooks, videos, plays, poems, novels, magazines, etc. Efforts to preserve and promote all Indian languages, including classical, tribal and endangered languages, will be taken on with new vigour. Technology and crowd-sourcing, with extensive participation of the people, will play a crucial role in these efforts. Higher education institutes and more programmes in higher education are expected to use the mother tongue/local language as a medium of instruction, and/or offer programmes bilingually, to promote the strength, usage, and vibrancy of all Indian languages, besides enhancing Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER). Sanskrit which possesses rich classical literature and contains a rich knowledge system will be offered at all levels of school and higher education as an important, enriching option for students, including as an option in the three-language formula. The NEP recommends mainstreaming Sanskrit with strong offerings in school - including as one of the language options in the three-language formula - as well as in higher education considering its vast and significant contributions and richness. Sanskrit so far has been taught through either English or Hindi, and the NEP proposes teaching Sanskrit through Sanskrit. The NEP 2020 also recommends students' participation in a fun project/activity on 'The Languages of India', sometime in Grades 6-8, such as, under the 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat' initiative. In this project/activity, students will learn about the remarkable unity of most of the major Indian languages. Such activity is expected to give them both a sense of unity and the beautiful cultural heritage and diversity of India. In addition to high-quality offerings in Indian languages and English, the NEP recommends foreign languages, such as Korean, Japanese, Thai, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian, to be offered at the secondary level, for students to learn about the cultures of the world and to enrich their global knowledge and mobility according to their interests and aspirations. Implementing such an intricate and ambitious language policy that aims at initiating the steady flow of knowledge from one language to another and uniting young minds across diverse cultures with the same feeling of Indianness is a Herculean task. Realizing this tremendously difficult task the new policy holds that India will urgently expand its translation and interpretation efforts to make high-quality learning materials and other important written and spoken material available to the public in various Indian and foreign languages. For this, an Indian Institute of Translation and Interpretation (IITI) will be established. Such an institute would provide a truly important service for the country, as well as employ numerous multilingual language and subject experts, and experts in translation and interpretation, which will help to promote all Indian languages. The IITI shall also make extensive use of technology to aid in its translation and interpretation efforts. The policy also recommends high-quality textbooks, including in science, to be made available in home languages. There will be a major effort from both the Central and State governments to invest in large numbers of language teachers in all regional languages around the country, and, in particular, for all languages mentioned in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. States, especially States from different regions of India, may enter into bilateral agreements to hire teachers in large numbers. Thus the NEP-2020 is going to initiate a great paradigm shift in language teaching. A lot of things have been suggested in the NEP-2020 regarding language teaching and harnessing the power of language for national unity that sound novel and soothing to the ear, but time will tell whether those are practically achievable or workable.\nsentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/nep-2020-and-new-language-policy-for-upholding-the-multicultural-ethos/","tags":["Editorial,More"],"title":"NEP-2020 and new language policy for upholding the multicultural ethos"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Amazon Smartphone Upgrade Days sale: Know offer details, discounts and more Started on October 25, the Amazon Smartphone Upgrade Days sale would continue until October 28\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/amazon-smartphone-upgrade-days-sale-know-offer-details-discounts-and-more/","tags":[],"title":"Amazon Smartphone Upgrade Days sale: Know offer details, discounts and more"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Housing sales in top 7 cities gain momentum in the ongoing Diwali festive period As per the latest research by real estate consultancy firm Anarock, total sales in the top seven cities can exceed 3.6 lakh units in 2022.\nNEW DELHI: Going by the momentum of housing sales in the ongoing festive period and that of the first three quarters of this year, 2022 is likely to breach the previous peak of 2014 with an all-time high sales across the top seven cities.As per the latest research by real estate consultancy firm Anarock, total sales in the top seven cities can exceed 3.6 lakh units in 2022. In the previous peak year of 2014, the cities saw the sale of 3.43 lakh units. The January-September period of 2022 saw housing sales and new launches surpass the full-year readings of 2019 with nearly 2.73 lakh units sold in nine months of 2022 and new launches at 2.65 lakh units. 2019 saw over 2.61 lakh units sold in the entire year, while new supply stood at 2.34 lakh units. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and NCR have retained their top slot rankings in the first nine months of 2022. Nearly 1,30,450 units were collectively sold in these two regions, accounting for 48 per cent of the total sales in the top seven cities. Other high-selling cities were Pune, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, which accounted for a 42 per cent cumulative sales share. Housing sales remained strong despite average property prices increasing in 2022, with the annual price appreciation in Q3 2022 being the best in the past seven years — 6 per cent against Q3 2021. Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Group, said: \"2022 will create residential market history in India, having already breached all previous highs and continuing to witness strong sales momentum in the ongoing festive season. Homeownership sentiment retained the vibrancy ushered in by the Covid-19 era, despite interest rates hikes of 190 bps, increased property rates, and the conspicuous lack of festive season offers and discounts this year.\" A combination of end-user and investor demand continues to zero in on projects by large and listed developers. These players report consistently high sales and are stepping up new supply infusions into the market. Total new launches in 2022 will remain lower than the previous peak of 2014, which saw approximately 5.45 lakh homes launched across the top 7 cities.

He also posted a video on the platform with the caption: \"Entering Twitter HQ: let that sink in!\"Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in! pic.twitter.com/D68z4K2wq7— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 26, 2022 The Tesla boss is sure the deal will be done this time, as his Twitter bio is now updated to \"Chief Twit.\" Musk first offered to buy Twitter in early March but backed out of the deal in July. After the social media giant sued the 51-year-old billionaire, he offered to buy back the company at the same price. The court that heard the matter ordered Musk to close the deal by October 27.Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reports that banks have begun sending $13 billion in cash to support Musk's takeover of Twitter. This offers a clearer sign that the deal may soon close by the end of the week. Once the final closing conditions are met will make the funds available for Musk to execute the transaction before the Friday deadline.It's unclear what convinced Musk to buy back Twitter, but some reports speculate that the Tesla boss doesn't want details of the initial proceedings made public. More internal details emerged online after Twitter presented conversations between Musk and Twitter executives, including current CEO Parag Agrawal and former boss Jack Dorsey in court. Private messages highlighted that Musk was initially reluctant to join Twitter's board. It was also confirmed by Agrawal in a tweet.In fact, after investing in Twitter but before announcing his offer to buy it, Musk and Parag exchanged a couple of text messages that clearly hinted at a breakup. Musk, as his texts indicate, doesn't think Parag is the kind of person who can manage Twitter. A recent report noted that Musk would likely lay off 75 per cent of the workforce once the Twitter deal is finalized. His decision derives from saving the cost of operating the company. This will reduce the headcount from 7,500 to 2,000.\nthehansindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/elon-musk-updates-his-twitter-bio-to-chief-twit/","tags":["Tech,Tech News"],"title":"Elon Musk updates his Twitter bio to \"Chief Twit\""},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Tesla faces criminal probe in the United States over self-driving electric vehicle claims: Report Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Inc, electric vehicle automaker once described the Tesla's autopilot as “probably better” than a human driver.\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/tesla-faces-criminal-probe-in-the-united-states-over-self-driving-electric-/","tags":[],"title":"Tesla faces criminal probe in the United States over self-driving electric vehicle claims: Report"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Wade expected to face England despite testing Covid positive Wade is believed to be suffering only minor symptoms and, unless his condition deteriorates, is still expected to feature in Friday’s high-stakes match against England at the MCG.\nsportstar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/wade-expected-to-face-england-despite-testing-covid-positive/","tags":[],"title":"Wade expected to face England despite testing Covid positive"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Indian Government receives dividends worth Rs 361 cr from Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) Secretary in the department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) Tuhin Kanta Pandey tweeted the details on his official Twitter account.\nNEW DELHI: The government has received Rs 129 crore, Rs 76 crore and Rs 33 crore from SJVN, Antariksh Corporation of India and Manganese Ore (India) Ltd, respectively, as dividend tranches.Secretary in the department of investment and public asset management (DIPAM) Tuhin Kanta Pandey tweeted the details on his official Twitter account.

According to niche news publisher BanklessTimes.com, the Ethereum merge created a lot of Buzz, with every crypto lover patiently awaiting its arrival. The Merge has been a success, and Ethereum's dominance in the market is increasing, said the report. \"Ethereum dominance is rising as we expected. The environmentally friendly approach it took identifies well with crypto users. Besides, more people are adopting Ethereum than Bitcoin due to the Merge. The pace is set, and Ethereum will continue to rise,\" said Jonathan Merry, CEO of BanklessTimes.com. Currently, the blockchain is preparing for the Shanghai upgrade. Ethereum anticipates going through the \"Surge,\" \"Verge,\" and \"Purge\" after the Shanghai upgrade. Surge is the application of \"sharding\" technology. The technology will enhance Ethereum's maximum transaction processing pace from 15 to 20 transactions per second to over 100,000. Next is the verge, which is the planned application of a mathematical proof called \"Verkle trees.\" The App will allow nodes on the blockchain to function without downloading the entire chain's history. Lastly, the purge will remove all legacy data from the chain. Combining these three improvements will create a better Ethereum blockchain. Some have said that Ethereum will one day take Bitcoin's place in market capitalisation, an event referred to as \"the Flippening.\" \"The post-Merge era will be very critical for Ethereum.

This is our first-ever end-to-end shopping experience on WhatsApp — people can now buy groceries from JioMart right in a chat,” Zuckerberg had said in an earlier Facebook Post. “Business messaging is an area with real momentum and chat-based experiences like this will be the go-to way people and businesses communicate in the years to come,” he added. Users can start shopping on JioMart via WhatsApp by simply sending ‘Hi’ to the JioMart number on WhatsApp.\norissapost\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/jiomart-on-whatsapp-a-big-opportunity-for-us-zuckerberg/","tags":["Sci-Tech","JioMart","WhatsApp","Zuckerberg"],"title":"JioMart on WhatsApp a big opportunity for us: Zuckerberg"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"PAK vs ZIM Dream11 Team Prediction, Match Preview, Fantasy Cricket Hints: Captain, Probable Playing 11s, Team News; Injury Updates For Today’s PAK vs ZIM T20 World Cup 2022 Super 12 in Sydney, 430 PM IST, October 27 Pakistan vs Zimbabwe Dream11 Team Prediction Pakistan vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2022 Super 12 Preview - Check My Dream11 Team, Best players list of PAK vs ZIM, Pakistan Dream11 Team Player List, Zimbabwe Dream11 Team Player List, Dream11 Guru Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Cricket Tips, Fantasy Playing Tips.\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/pak-vs-zim-dream11-team-prediction-match-preview-fantasy-cricket-hints-c/","tags":[],"title":"PAK vs ZIM Dream11 Team Prediction, Match Preview, Fantasy Cricket Hints: Captain, Probable Playing 11s, Team News; Injury Updates For Today’s PAK vs ZIM T20 World Cup 2022 Super 12 in Sydney, 430 PM IST, October 27"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"TotalEnergies Takes Temporary Control Of Offshore Gas Block In Lebanon The Lebanese caretaker government has awarded TotalEnergies temporary control of an offshore gas block after the exit of Russian Novatek last month.

Reuters reports that now the Lebanese government and TotalEnergies will begin negotiations with Qatar over taking a stake in the project. According to documents produced by the Lebanese government and seen by Reuters, the 20 percent that Novatek held in the project was transferred to another company and TotalEnergies’ 40-percent holding in the gas block was also transferred to another company. Details about the ownership of the two companies, Daja 2016 and Daja 2015 were not disclosed. Lebanon is eager to develop its potential gas reserves like its neighbor Israel, which has made several major discoveries in recent years. Yet a maritime border dispute between the two countries has delayed Lebanon’s exploration plans. The dispute centered on yet another gas deposit, the Karish field, which lies between the two countries. The field’s reserves are estimated at 1.41 trillion cubic feet. The final investment decision on developing the field was made in 2018. According to Israel, Karish lies in its territorial waters. According to Lebanon, it falls within a triangle of contested waters because the two cannot agree on where exactly the border passes. As Reuters put it in a report from earlier this year, \"Israel claims the boundary runs further north than Lebanon accepts, while Lebanon claims it runs further south than Israel accepts, leaving a triangle of disputed waters.\" Meanwhile, UK-based Energean began drilling at the Karish field earlier this month, while Israel and Lebanon negotiated a U.S.-brokered maritime border deal. The deal was agreed upon this month and should enter into effect this week. Under the agreement, the Karish oil and gas field and an area known as the Qanaa prospect are expected to be in Israeli and Lebanese waters, respectively. Lebanon said TotalEnergies will begin exploration work on the Qanaa prospect immediately.

A larger iPad model than the existing 12.9-inch model has been rumored for years, though Apple has never announced anything. A new leak from someone claiming to be familiar with Apple's product plans claims a 16-inch iPad is coming. According to a report from The Information , the leaker says Apple could reveal a 16-inch iPad in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, they warned that the date could change or the product could be killed in development. There has been plenty of speculation around a larger iPad model, though credible evidence has yet to surface. The leaker refers to the iPad without any name attached, but it is likely going to fall under the iPad Pro branding. In 2021 , Mark Gurman suggested that a larger iPad Pro would arrive \"a couple of years down the road at the earliest.\" In June, a different leak from display supply chain analyst Ross Young suggested a 14-inch iPad could be coming and not be a pro model. Either the 14-inch iPad or 16-inch iPad could exist, or both, since the display sizes line up with existing products. Apple's Liquid Retina XDR display used on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is already available in the 14-inch MacBook Pro and 16-inch MacBook Pro . Apple updated its iPad Pro lineup in October with the M2 processor and little else of note. This minor update left Apple fans confused, as the redesigned 10.9-inch iPad got a new landscape FaceTime camera, but not the iPad Pro. The iPad Pro tends to be updated on an 18-month cycle, so a fourth-quarter 2023 announcement would be early by Apple's normal schedule. However, a new display size could warrant an earlier-than-usual announcement Apple's lack of care with gambling app ads is a symptom of a bigger problem Apple can argue about privacy, it can claim to put users before anything else, but when its business runs on gambling ads, it's moving yet further away from its stated principles and becoming a gambling company.

The app asks for access to your vital signs data and can detect stats like your heart rate with a watch face-like UI for showing your heart rate. You can also connect this data with your classes to show data about your pace and more, but all workouts need to be started on your paired smartphone. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t appear to have any support for pairing with your Peloton bike. The ability to pair your smartwatch to Peloton gear has been requested by fans for years and was finally added earlier this year with Apple Watch integration on the Peloton Bike+ . The same integration does not appear to be available on the Wear OS app in any capacity. Our Max Weinbach further points out that this app seems to be aiming at Apple’s Fitness+ experience more than anything else. Just like with Apple’s service, Peloton lets you view classes through its app and sync the data from your watch, the main difference, of course, being that Peloton’s service now works with both Apple-focused and Android-focused smartwatches. You can install the Peloton app for Wear OS now through the Play Store . Max Weinbach contributed to this article. Thanks, Leeroy!

Known as ‘Baby AB’ due to his uncanny resemblance with the South African legendary cricketer AB de Villiers’s style of batting, Dewald Brevis has trudged a path of ascendency since his remarkable batting performance during the ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup in West Indies this year. Impressed by his potential, he was also roped in by the five-time IPL franchise Mumbai Indians (MI) during the mega auction that took place a month later, where he played seven matches for the franchise, and turned up with a few eye-catching innings, like the one versus Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Pune, which made him a household name. Even during this year’s Caribbean Premier League (CPL), he turned the Cricket fans’ attention towards him, when he smashed 5 Sixes off the six deliveries he faced while playing for the St Kitts and Nevis Patriots at Guyana. On the social media platform Twitter, the 19-year-old was yet again the point of discussion, when an argument of sorts broke out between the legendary South African batter Herschelle Gibbs and South Africa’s Performance Analyst from 2010-2021, regarding whether or not he deserves a place in the Proteas national side at the earliest. Dewald Brevis IPL salary During the mega auction ahead of IPL’s 15th edition this year, Dewald Brevis was roped in at a hefty amount of INR 3 Crores. Having registered himself for the auction at the base price of INR 20 Lakhs, Brevis finally became part of the MI squad, after the likes of Punjab Kings (PBKS) and later the four-time champions Chennai Super Kings (CSK) also showed keen interest to rope in this rising Proteas talent in their squad. What is the net worth of Baby AB de Villiers? As per reports, Dewald Brevis’ net worth is to the tune of $2 million in the year 2022, which roughly translates to around INR 16 Crore.

Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced in a press release that Unilever US issued a “voluntary product recall” of select dry shampoo aerosol products produced prior to October 2021, from Dove, Nexxus, Suave, TIGI (Rockaholic and Bed Head), and TRESemmé due to “potentially elevated levels of benzene”. It mentioned that benzene is classified as a “human carcinogen”, and that its exposure can occur by “inhalation, orally, and through the skin”. Per the statement, it can result in cancers including leukemia and blood cancer of the bone marrow, and blood disorders that can be “life-threatening”. The FDA added in its announcement that benzene is “ubiquitous in the environment” and that human beings around the world have “daily exposures to it indoors and outdoors from multiple sources”.

Although benzene can be created by natural processes like volcanoes and forest fires, human activity is the main cause of benzene exposure,” she said. Short-term effects According to the doctor, high concentrations of benzene in the air can have an adverse effect on the nervous system , resulting in fatigue, headaches, tremors, confusion, and/or unconsciousness. “High amounts of benzene in food or drink can lead to nausea, vomiting, stomach discomfort, drowsiness, seizures, and a rapid/irregular heartbeat. In many cases, it can be fatal when inhaled or ingested in extremely-high concentrations. The skin, eyes, and throat can get irritated when exposed to benzene liquid or vapour. Blisters and redness can develop on the skin after contact to benzene,” she cautioned. Advertisement People are exposed to it through a variety of sources, including gas stations, cigarettes, detergents, glues, and paints. (Photo: Getty/Thinkstock) Long-term effects Dr Srivastava explained that the main area of the body affected by long-term benzene exposure is the bone marrow — the soft interior of the bone, where new blood cells are produced.

The new tablets are expensive, but our reviews found them to be among the best iPads Apple has ever made. The base model iPad gets a complete redesign, while the iPad Pro 11 (2022) and iPad Pro 12.9 (2022) get the laptop-class Apple M2 chip. The iPad 10.9 starts at $449 / £499 / AU$749 for a 64GB model with Wi-Fi only, which would be fine for web browsing and streaming movies and shows. If you plan on downloading a lot of games and shows for taking the tablet on the go, you’ll want to upgrade to 256GB of storage, which will run you $599 / £679 / AU$999; a hefty increase. (Image credit: Future) If you’re also interested in picking up an Apple Pencil to go with your new iPad, remember that the new iPad 10.9 only works with the older Apple Pencil, not the second generation stylus. If you have a Pencil already, you’ll need to pick up the USB-C adapter to charge it, as the new iPad uses USB-C instead of Lightning (one of the reasons we recommend buying an older iPad Air 4 over this new model).\nThe new iPad Pro comes in two sizes. We got a chance to review the iPad Pro 12.9 (2022) at launch, and our editor Matt Bolton said it was “Apple's biggest and boldest iPad to date, with a new M2 chipset that serves up more power than 99% of us will ever need.” The tablet at the top of Apple’s lineup starts at $1,099 / £1,249 / AU$1,899.\nSadly, you’ll definitely need to upgrade the storage on the iPad Pro to at least 256GB, because the new ProRes video recording feature is weakened if you don’t. If your iPad Pro 11 or 12.9 has only 128GB of storage, it will only record ProRes at Full HD resolution, not in 4K. The 4K video files are around 7GB per minute.\nThere are also new accessories for the iPad, including the unusual split-design Apple Magic Keyboard Folio. The Folio is actually a back protector for the iPad 10.9 with a fold-out stand, and a separate keyboard that covers the front as well. The new Magic Keyboard costs more than half as much as an iPad, so it’s a premium addition, for sure.\nApple iPad Air (2022) (Image credit: Future) Now that the new models have hit the market, it’s a fine time to start scoping out some great iPad deals. There is still a month to go before Black Friday, so it’s possible we could see a tiny little discount on these new models as a late Black Friday iPad deal or maybe a Cyber Monday special.\nIf these new iPads don’t float your boat, check out the iPad Air (2022). That device gives you plenty of what you like about the look and feel of the new iPad 10.9, but with a more premium finish and a faster processor inside. All of these devices have earned their place on our list of the best tablets you can buy.\n\ntechradar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/you-can-buy-the-new-ipad-and-ipad-pro-starting-today/","tags":[],"title":"You can buy the new iPad and iPad Pro, starting today"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"vivo X90 to have Dimensity 9200 chipset and 120W fast charging The vivo X90 series will arrive in December, and the X90 Pro+ flagship will have a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset and a top-notch camera.

AEW has housed several WWE Superstars in the past. In fact, their first ever world champion, Chris Jericho, himself is a WWE legend. All but two AEW World Champions in the history of the company have made their name in WWE. Also read: AEW Backstage Sources Suggest Tony Khan Is Favoring the Elite over CM Punk The promotion is stacked with talented people from the indie scene and experienced heads from WWE and there was another major name that could have joined them back in 2019. However, Tony Khan balked at his steep asking price and the move never materialized. Kurt Angle reveals “substantial amount of money” he demanded from Tony Khan to wrestle in AEW Kurt Angle is one of the greatest wrestlers to have ever stepped foot inside a wrestling ring. It is no surprise that TK wanted him in his promotion. The AEW President would have known that the Olympic Gold Medalist wasn’t going to come cheap. However, he wouldn’t have expected him to be so expensive. Speaking on the latest episode of his ‘Kurt Angle Show podcast’, Angle revealed that he wanted 3 million for 10 matches. “It’s gonna have to be a substantial amount of money too. I do remember Tony Khan, you know, wanted me to come in and wrestle for him. This was like when they first started. And I said for 10 matches I want 3 million, that’s 300 grand a match.” It’s quite obvious why Tony Khan and Kurt Angle failed to reach an agreement. A prime Kurt Angle would have been worth every cent. However, to pay that much for a recently retired Kurt Angle who was no longer the wrestling machine he once was, was a risk he was not willing to take. AEW makes the list of Fast Company’s “Brands That Matter” List The Tony Khan led wrestling promotion has been included in Fast Company’s “Brands That Matter” List. This list recognizes companies leading on social action, sustainability, inclusivity, and fun. Khan lauded the achievement and spoke about how for the first time in two decades, wrestling fans finally had a legitimate and competitive alternate to WWE. AEW was founded in 2019. It has since established two weekly shows in Dynamite and Rampage along with a few more YouTube shows. They also have several special episodes and Pay Per View events. Tony Khan also purchased Ring of Honor earlier this year and has been pitching a separate show for it. All in all, the promotion has done a lot of rights since its inception and barring a few hiccups, it doesn’t seem like they’re slowing down any time soon.

Wednesday’s surge in price comes as the global cryptocurrency market was up by nearly 7% on the day. Cardano also traded higher, climbing by over 10% in the process. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) rose higher for a second straight session, as the token surged to a multi-month high on Wednesday. During today’s session, DOGE/USD surged to an intraday peak of $0.06868, which comes a day after it was trading at a low of $0.06062. Wednesday’s top saw the meme coin hit its highest point since August 25, when the token reached a top of $0.0718. Looking at the chart, today’s move comes as DOGE rose above a key resistance point of $0.0670. As a result of today’s peak, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also hit its strongest mark since mid-August. An upward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages also seems imminent, which could lead to dogecoin climbing above $0.0700. Cardano (ADA) Another notable mover in today’s session was cardano (ADA), which rallied by over 10% on hump-day. Following a low of $0.3704 on Tuesday, ADA/USD moved to a high of $0.4142 earlier in today’s session. The move saw cardano hit its highest point in two weeks, with bulls seemingly targeting a key resistance point. Looking at the chart, the aforementioned ceiling appears to be the $0.4325 point, which was last hit on October 10. Bulls hoping to move towards this mark may face opposition, as the RSI nears a roof of its own. The index is currently tracking at 55.18, which is marginally below a resistance point of 58.00.

Making the most of the extended festive weekend this year are the two releases Thank God and Ram Setu. While the first features Sidharth Malhotra and Ajay Devgn the second headlines Akshay Kumar. But which of the two vastly different films will manage to capture the audiences’ attention is the question. In the domestic market, the Akshay starrer Ram Setu has taken the lead at the box office, with Thank God in close pursuit. On the other hand, in the overseas market of UK, it is the Sidharth Malhotra – Ajay Devgn starrer Thank God that leads the charge. Collecting USD 19,472 [Rs. 15.97 lakhs] from 83 screens the film has taken a lead over Ram Setu which drew in USD 16,595 [Rs. 13.61 lakhs] from 95 screens on Day 1. Surprisingly, despite featuring a higher screen count Ram Setu seems to be lagging behind, however given the positive feedback the film has received from the audience it is likely to see growth over the coming day. As of now, Thank God which has garnered good reviews from audience and critics is likely to hold strong with a good increase in collections on the card, while Ram Setu will have to rely on positive word of mouth going forward.

Lewis Hamilton was a guest on the American talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live. The 7-time World Champion was introduced as the greatest F1 driver with the Sir referring to the title he inherited following his Knighthood. Hamilton received his knighthood at Windsor Castle from then Prince Charles. He is only the 4th British driver to receive a knighthood after Sir Jackie Stewart, Sir Stirling Moss and Sir Jack Brabham. Hamilton has equalled Michael Schumacher’s record of 7 titles and has broken multiple records. But he has also set an example by being a vocal advocate for racial awareness and equality. Jimmy Kimmel asked the Briton what it felt like before receiving the knighthood. And Lewis narrated an interesting incident when King Charles met him for the first time when he had inaugurated McLaren’s facilities. Lewis said, “I met him when I was 13. I was with McLaren and he came to open the factory. And I was sitting in my go-kart. And he knelt down and asked me what I wanted to do, my dreams were.” What a difference 25 years makes. Prince Charles visiting LH as a kid, and now presenting #SirLewisHamilton with his Knighthood. @LewisHamilton is an inspiration to all. #7xChamp #RecordBreaker pic.twitter.com/kgxHSjQVKw — TP (@pacman1520) December 15, 2021 Lewis said the entire event is carried out in an extremely formal way. But after he was knighted, Charles spoke with him and had a small chat. Lewis said, “After receiving the knighthood, he told me I had come a long way.” He even remembered speaking to Lewis when he was a kid, a remarkable moment for Hamilton who realised how far he had come. Also Read: Lewis Hamilton and Brad Pitt have $140 million F1 movie meeting amidst US Grand Prix Lewis Hamilton’s dad didn’t know what to call him! Lewis Hamilton has credited his father as the reason for his success. His father, Anthony Hamilton had worked 4 jobs to sponsor his Karting career. This was necessary in order to fulfil Lewis’s F1 hopes. Funnily, his dad got confused after Lewis told him he would be getting the knighthood. Lewis said, “I called my dad after I received the call about me receiving my knighthood. And we were just reminiscing amazing it is.” Lewis adds, “And then he asked me, ‘Do I have to call you Sir now?'” To which Lewis said yes, jokingly. But Lewis has some family members who address him with his prefix. “My niece and nephew call me ‘Sir Uncle,'” says Lewis.

He said, “When we were racing there was a lot of discrimination cause we were the only people of colour on the racetrack. My dad said just do your talking on the track.” Anthony Hamilton would ensure nothing affects his sons’ progress. While Lewis would go and dominate the Karting scene and would climb his way up to F1.

The Lakers played the Golden State Warriors, the Los Angeles Clippers, and the Portland Trailblazers in the first three games and lost all three. These three games have shown the major gaps in the playbook of the Lakers, showing how poor they are in the shooting department. To say the Lakers have struggled to put the ball into the net is an understatement. The three guards who have played this season have combined for a whopping 28% from the field. Russell Westbrook missed all his shots in the second game. There is a reason why he’s been left open, but only he does not realize it. Even the players who’ve scored their points haven’t been effective. The leaders, LeBron James, and Anthony Davis have struggled with their shooting percentages. They’ve made up for it by surprisingly making their free throws. All of this put together has made the Lakers the worst in the league for offensive rating. Dead last in a league that has teams like the Houston Rockets and the Oklahoma City Thunder. Rob Pelinka should be ashamed to construct a team of such caliber.

They had their flaws, yes, but man, they were fun. The whole roster went down, and LeBron even played defense! Who knew? That cohesive nature, along with their defensive ability, put them at the top of the ratings that year. And guess what, they won a championship. This year, they’ve started with great ratings on their side of the court. They lead the league (small sample size of 3 games played). In comparison, last year’s champions, the Golden State Warriors, rank 22nd. It is a worrisome fact, but their offense seems to always outscore their opponents. What the Lakers have is a roadmap to success. They have one side of the field locked in. They need the other side to shore up fast. The season may look young, but in the blink of an eye, it will be All-Star season once more. Among teams with a 3-game sample size, the best defensive rating in the NBA belongs to: The Los Angeles Lakers. pic.twitter.com/tSY1abL8Bi — StatMuse (@statmuse) October 24, 2022 Also Read: “I have to look LeBron James in the eye”: Kevin Durant revealed his perception of the King as a teenager Is the King’s reign over? Is it time to hand over the reins to another kid from Akron? Kevin Garnett believes it is time to retire Bron and hand the reigns over to Stephen Curry. The younger Akron man has won four rings in the era of LeBron, and it only seems logical to call it his time. Individually, the King is still the head honcho when he wants to be. But the only thing is that he has been dealt a bad hand. He has a couple of bullets, while the rest of the league seems to have straight flushes all around him. The game has evolved, and the Lakers are stuck in the past. Even if they did the fundamentals right, we’d be talking about the Lakers being undefeated. No team has ever been top of the defensive rating but been dead last in their conference-but the Lakers are. The last three times Bron went 0-3, he missed the playoffs.

Which brings the total up to four incidents, with Nvidia already having said it’s investigating the first report which reached the company’s ears.\nThe purported problem is with the 16-pin connector that needs an adapter (4 x 8-pin to 16-pin) to hook up the RTX 4090 to an ATX 2.0 PSU (as opposed to an ATX 3.0 product, models fresh on the scene which can directly use the 16-pin connector).\nThe problem is that it’s difficult to fit that adapter in many PC cases, with it having to be bent round at a sharp angle – and the pins not being seated properly as a result has been seen as the most likely culprit for these alarming instances of cables melting.\nThe theory is that having a right-angled power connector – one that can more easily fit in the PC case without having to be jammed up against the side panel (or close to it) – will mean less strain on the connector, and less likelihood of it not being fitted properly to the 4090 graphics card.\nThis solution is what Seasonic is apparently ushering in, as seen on Chinese forum Bilibili, a post which HXL flagged up on Twitter (again via Tom’s Hardware). Add your own seasoning as ever with sources like this.\nSeasonic 90° L-type 12VHPWR interfacehttps://t.co/fUfAtiFFjj pic.twitter.com/7J30Tt5B9NOctober 25, 2022\nSee more  Analysis: A necessary visit to caveat corner Seasonic isn’t the first company to have had this particular brainwave, as you may be aware. Cablemod has already aired its 90-degree angled adapter solution, one that’s supposed to be available for pre-order come the end of October.\nWe don’t yet know when Seasonic’s take on the right-angled adapter for the RTX 4090 will arrive, or indeed if it will – remember, this is info pulled from Bilibili, so we should regard it with a great deal of caution. And the Bilibili poster further notes that it’s just a sample product (in the comments), so we don’t have any confirmation it will be realized.\nThere are other caveats here, too, with these kinds of third-party adapters. Remember that Nvidia does not allow for the use of anything but the official adapter with the RTX 4090 – and turning to an alternative will void your warranty. That’s a serious issue right there, of course.\nSome folks are also arguing that it’s not the cable angle, as much as the fundamental design of the connector itself which is the real problem in dealing with the wattage which can be gulped down by the RTX 4090. (Considerably more than 450W with spikes in power usage, particularly if you’re looking at overclocked custom models of the 4090, naturally). But if that connector isn’t up to the job, surely that would be something Nvidia’s testing would’ve uncovered – or we’d hope so, anyway.\nAnd if the problem is one of seating the connector, the most prominent theory, surely a right-angled adapter would at least help somewhat in terms of mitigating any tension caused by having to bend a stiff cable around?\nAll of this is speculation at the moment, though, and we need Nvidia’s official word on what’s going on with these worrying cases of cable melt, naturally. Hopefully that’ll be forthcoming soon enough, and equally we can hope that we won’t get more reports of this problem coming in from other RTX 4090 buyers – as if that reality comes to fruition, well, obviously that’d be very disappointing.\nMeanwhile, AMD has been quick to confirm that its next-gen RDNA 3 flagship, which is on the verge of being revealed, will not use the same style of power adapter as the RTX 4090.\n\ntechradar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/nvidia-rtx-4090-cable-controversy-rolls-on-as-psu-maker-looks-to-help-owner/","tags":[],"title":"Nvidia RTX 4090 cable controversy rolls on as PSU maker looks to help owners"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Google Store extends boosted trade-ins for Pixel 7 through November If you’ve been hoping to pick up a Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, the Google Store has yet again boosted trade-in values for a limited time. more… The post Google Store extends boosted trade-ins for Pixel 7 through November appeared first on 9to5Google.\n9to5google\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/google-store-extends-boosted-trade-ins-for-pixel-7-through-november/","tags":[],"title":"Google Store extends boosted trade-ins for Pixel 7 through November"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Nothing launches design heavy Ear Stick TWS Nothing Ear Stick will be sold on Flipkart and Myntra\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/nothing-launches-design-heavy-ear-stick-tws/","tags":[],"title":"Nothing launches design heavy Ear Stick TWS"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Industry divided over impact of battery swapping on innovation The swapping, in its current form, will require a great deal of battery standardisation, which, many in the industry feel may not leave any room for innovation and product differentiation and curb investments in the sector\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/industry-divided-over-impact-of-battery-swapping-on-innovation/","tags":[],"title":"Industry divided over impact of battery swapping on innovation"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Bhai Dooj 2022: Salman Khan to Shweta Bachchan, how Bollywood celebs are wishing their siblings Bhai Dooj 2022: Bollywood celebrities never lack behind to embrace the festivities.

The new model carries the same 61-megapixel resolution as the A7R IV, but has a much more powerful new Bionz XR processor that allows for improved AI autofocus, better shake reduction and 8K 24p video. The key improvement is in the autofocus, as the A7R V is Sony's first camera to introduced something called \"human pose estimation.\" The system can see 20 different points in the human body and and thus figure out where the eye is supposed to be. That allows it to accurately track someone who might be moving and turning away from the camera, and keep tracking them even if they disappear from view for a moment. On top of that, it can now pick out different subjects like cars, trains, plains, animals and insects.Though the A7R V is primarily targeted at photographers, it's much better at video than ever, too. Where the A7R IV was limited to 8-bit 4K at 30fps with either cropping or line-skipping, the A7R V now shoots 8K video at up to 24 fps, along with 6.2K without line-skipping or pixel binning. With the same heatsink as the A7S III, it allows for unlimited 4K recording and up to 30 minutes of 8K capture.It can also handle supersampled 10-bit 4K video using the entire sensor width at up to 30 fps, or at 60fps with a 1.2x crop. You can also capture 16-bit RAW video to external recorders at up to 4K 60p. Sony has upgraded to the in-body stabilization (IBS) system from 5.5 to 8 stops, now matching what Canon can do with its similarly-priced EOS R5. And in lieu of the tilting display used in the A7R IV, the new model has a fully articulating screen that makes it more useful for high-angle shooting, video and more. The A7R V shoots at the same 10fps speeds as before, which is impressive for such a high-resolution camera. However, it can now shoot compressed RAW files rather than just uncompressed as before. The buffer can also handle up to 583 shots, letting you shoot for a large amount of time in a burst. SonyIt has a long list of other attractive features, including a class-leading 9.44-million-dot electronic viewfinder (EVF) and dual card slots that accept either speedy (but expensive) CFexpress Type A or UHS-II cards. Another new feature is pixel shift multishot (tripod use only) for compositing 16 shots into one 240.8-megapixel image using AI processing to automatically detect and correct movement between frames. The list continues with AI-powered white balance, focus stacking of up to 299 frames for increased depth of field, Sony's Cinetone color profile for a more film-like look, an updated body with dials and controls similar to the A7 IV, USB-C charging with Power Delivery and native webcam compatibility. The Sony A7R V is set to arrive in December for $3,900. Sony\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/sonys-high-resolution-a7r-v-mirrorless-camera-now-shoots-8k-video/","tags":["Consumer Discretionary","Cameras \u0026 Photography","Technology \u0026 Electronics","site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Steve Dent"],"title":"Sony's high-resolution A7R V mirrorless camera now shoots 8K video"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"BJP seeks Central forces for bypoll thehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/bjp-seeks-central-forces-for-bypoll/","tags":[],"title":"BJP seeks Central forces for bypoll"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Assam: State Government Launches App to Educate New Generation about Lachit Borphukan \"In this app, one can express his or her feelings regarding Lachit Borphukan by writing them down.

The match is scheduled to begin immediately after the conclusion of Match 22 between South Africa and Bangladesh in the afternoon. With rain predicted to pour over the SCG in the first match, it wouldn’t be a surprise if the start time of the second match gets delayed. Having said that, weather forecast for India-Netherlands contest is quite supportive of live action to happen. Readers must note that both India and Netherlands have started this round in contrasting manner. While India were involved in a nail-biting cliffhanger against Pakistan which will be remembered for ages, Netherlands had ended up on the losing side in a low-profile match against Bangladesh. India vs Netherlands T20 head to head records It is worth mentioning that this match will mark the first-ever instance of these two teams facing each other in a T20I. Therefore, there are no head-to-head records for an India-Netherlands T20I. Historically, India and Netherlands have faced each other in a couple of ODIs during ICC Cricket World Cup 2003 and ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. India, who had emerged as the victorious side on both the occasions, will have sight on a third consecutive victory against Netherlands across formats. India batter Virat Kohli and Netherlands batter Tom Cooper are the only two cricketers to have played that match 11 years ago. As far as taking part in T20Is at the Sydney Cricket Ground is concerned, India have won three and lost one out of their four matches in the past here. Netherlands, on the other hand, will be playing at this iconic venue for the first time tomorrow.

The longtime manager of Khabib Nurmagomedov has passed a scathing verdict at the expense of the bantamweight division. Aljamain Sterling reigned supreme in his quest for glory at UFC 280, when he defeated former UFC bantamweight champion, TJ Dillashaw, via ground and pound to claim a TKO. The triumph is Sterling’s second successful title defense having pinpointed Petr Yan to a decision earlier this year at UFC 273. However, Ali Abdelaziz, Khabib Nurmagomedov’s manager is also the manager of former UFC Bantamweight champion, Henry Cejudo who retired in 2020. It’s worth pointing out that Cejudo relinquished his title in 2020 with his retirement, thereby not losing it. @HenryCejudo he is the current bantamweight champion of the world and flyweight champion never lost his belt beat Dominick Cruz, TJ, Dillashaw, Demetrious Johnson nobody ever did that @espn @danawhite — Ali Abdelaziz (@AliAbdelaziz00) October 24, 2022 Taking to Twitter, Abdelaziz stated- “Henry Cejudo is the current bantamweight champion of the world and flyweight champion never lost his belt beat Dominick Cruz, TJ, Dillashaw, Demetrious Johnson nobody ever did that” Also read: “Like Seeing MJ Kobe and LeBron Together”: UFC Twitter Reacts as Chechen Warlord Settles Dispute Between Khamzat Chimaev and Team Khabib Nurmagomedov Henry Cejudo’s standpoint! Abdelaziz has been a cutthroat and forthright character and has once again come to the defense of his client, former Bantamweight champion, Henry Cejudo. Henry Cejudo prior to his retirement was an absolute savage. The American within the span of two years claimed victories against the very best the 135lbs weight class had to offer, in TJ Dillashaw, Marlon Moraes, Dominick Cruz, and Demetrious Johnson. A sublime martial artist, and an all-time great combat sports athlete. Henry Cejudo retired as the undisputed UFC Bantamweight champion, and as such will believe that he should be awarded a title shot, provided he returns.

While the statement remains true, that Cejudo never lost his belt, he was last seen inside the UFC octagon two years ago. A lot can happen in a span of two years. In this instance, the landscape of the division has tilted in all respects. Petr Yan’s decimation of Jose Aldo to win the title was the most probable outcome. The Russian seemed inevitable until an illegal knee would change his fortunes for the worse. In the meantime, Aljamain Sterling has conquered Petr Yan as well as TJ Dillashaw. In spectacular fashion, not to mention, utilizing his wrestling to nullify either opponent’s striking. As things stand, the era of the ‘funkmaster’, might just be scratching the surface, given the potential the Jamaican possesses. Although, a potential encounter between Aljamian Sterling and Henry Cejudo down the line would make for some exceptional martial arts.

If you talk about superstars with the best finishers in pro wrestling, Goldberg will always be on the list. Despite legends like Bret Hart regarding him as an unsafe opponent, the fame of his brutal spear and Jackhammer hasn’t declined. Historically, a superstar who is stiff in the ring has never been received well. Even “The Tribal Chief” Roman Reigns has addressed the issue in the past calling it a stupid thing to do. However, if you ask Goldberg, the Hall of Famer has a whole different standpoint on it. Recently, Da Man appeared on The Roman Atwood Podcast where he discussed the origin of his famous move. Recalling his WCW days, Goldberg shared how he was asked to run over his opponents every week. The 2-time WWE Universal Champion also gave his opinion on the remarks made by Roman Reigns about superstars who are stiff in the ring. Goldberg slams Roman Reigns’ perspective; says “It’s Pretty Smart” if one can blur the line While speaking on the show, the Hall of Famer shared anecdotes of his brutal spear and addressed the criticism behind it. Goldberg also mentioned Roman Reigns’ comment that said it is stupid to hit your opponent hard. Da Man didn’t agree with The Tribal Chief and instead, called it a smart move. He stated that if one can hit his opponent hard without hurting him, it’s okay. Not just that, Goldberg also took advantage of the situation to fire some shots at the current Undisputed Champion. The Hall of Famer said at least he doesn’t look like a girl while attacking his opponent in the ring. Da Man stated: “I’ll just be honest. Roman [Reigns] said how stupid it is to go out and hit people hard. Well, If you hit people hard and not hurt them, Blur That Line, I think it’s pretty smart. Plus, I don’t look like a, No Offense, girl when I tackle people.” There were some teasing comments made by Goldberg as the spear is Roman Reigns’ ultimate move. It will be interesting to see how The Head of the Table responds. Meanwhile, the almost-56-year-old also shed light on his time left in the squared circle. Goldberg stated he is just getting started with the ring During the show, the Hall of Famer was also asked whether he has ever thought about saying goodbye to the squared circle. Goldberg stated that it was just the beginning. His contract may be up, and he might be turning 56 in a couple of months, but his life has just begun. Da Man claimed he can take a break from wrestling only for a weekend. Anyway, it’s good news and in a way, assurance that Goldberg will be back in WWE. Now, when that will happen, and whether he will face Roman Reigns again, is yet to be known. In the meantime, The Tribal Chief will be defending his Undisputed Crown at Crown Jewel against YouTube Star Logan Paul. For More Wrestling News, Click Here.

We, in our clinics, often hear complaints from parents (who bring in their children for counselling) about a child’s reluctance to go to school, loss of interest in studies and a general tendency to remain shy and aloof. Mostly these complaints are about the girl child although there can be many exceptions too.\nAfter assessment of these cases it is often found that such behaviour is a result of sexual abuse. Studies say that 1 out of every 5 girls and 1 out of every 6 boys undergo sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse, which is also known as child molestation, is a form of abuse in which a child is used by an adult or older adolescent for sexual stimulation.Child sexual abuse occurs when the child is misled or pressurized into sexual activities. Child sexual abuse takes place in schools, colleges and at homes. There are different forms of sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse can be of two types-contact abuse and non-contact abuse. Contact abuse includes touching the child's private parts, making the child touch someone else's private parts, using a body part or object to rape or penetrate a child for sexual pleasure or forcing the child to perform sexual activities. Non-contact abuse includes showing images of person's private parts to a child, showing pornography to a child, photographing a child in sexual poses, encouraging a child to watch or hear sexual acts either in person or on a video, prostituting/trafficking the child and/or watching the child undress or take a bath in the bathroom. So what are the consequences of these unfortunate and heinous acts? In some cases, children hesitate to share these incidences with their family because they cannot judge whether the incident merits informing in the first place. Some children also do not report abuse fearing rejection from family members. The worst cases happen when parents know about the incidents but try to cover or hush up the situation. This mostly happens when the molestation is done by a family member or relatives. Parents mostly try to neglect the child's voice or often pressurize them to keep their thoughts bottled up. The consequences of abuse (in any form) are depression, anxiety, phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal ideation. Some others might display antisocial behavior, aggression and increased impulsivity. Experiencing child sexual abuse can also increase a person's risk for future victimization. For example, recent studies have found that women who have undergone child sexual abuse are more likely (2-3 times more) to become victims of sexual violence and people who experienced child sexual abuse have double the possibilities for experiencing intimate (non-sexual) partner violence. Thus, as care givers, how can one protect a child from sexual abuse? Although it is said that there are various preventive resources in terms of child sexual abuse, it is always the primary responsibility of the parents to ensure a safe and stable environment to the child. Resources for child sexual abuse have mostly focused on legal acts, treatment of victims and criminal justice-oriented approaches for the perpetrators. These things are applicable after child sexual abuse takes place. Therefore, it is more important to talk to children about physical touch and its precautionary measures. Body mapping is an exercise where children can find a safe space to talk about their stories of sexual abuse. It is an art-based technique, which focuses on embodied experience and tries to explore the bodily and psychological feelings and experiences of the victimized children. It basically includes a graphic picture of the human body highlighting the body parts through which you can ask children about their experience of physical touch in relation to their own body parts. The exact assessment (of whether the abuse has happened or not) can be done by putting a cross over the areas that are pleasurable and putting a tick mark in the unpleasant areas of the body. By Ms. Ankita Kakati Counselling Psychologist Faculty, MIND India, Guwahati Ask Dr Sangeeta Goswami Question: How can I know if my daughter is suffering from sexual abuse? There is no sure way to identify sexual abuse. Some of the red flags that a caregiver can look for are: Behavioral signs: • Excessive talk about or knowledge of sexual topics • Not talking as much as usual • Not wanting to be left alone with certain people or being afraid to be away from primary caregivers, especially if this is a new behavior • Regressive behaviors or resuming behaviors they had grown out of, such as thumbsucking or bedwetting • Overly compliant behavior • Sexual behavior that is inappropriate for the child's age • Trying to avoid removing clothing to change or bathe Emotional signs: • Change in mood or personality, such as increased aggression • Decrease in confidence or self-image • Excessive worry or fearfulness • Unexplained health problems such as stomach aches and headaches • Loss or decrease in interest in school, activities, and friends • Nightmares or fear of being alone at night The most important thing is to watch out for sudden changes in behaviour. Trust your gut and don't ignore your feelings if something seems off. If a child tells you that someone makes them uncomfortable, even if they can't tell you anything specific, listen and believe the child.

It was established in the year 1880 under British Rule. In the beginning, it had the responsibility for all public infrastructure development involving construction and maintenance works. In 1956 the Embankment and Drainage (E\u0026D) were bifurcated and established as a separate Department. The PWD has undergone considerable changes since Independence. To enable it to function smoothly and to focus on the priority assigned by the Government on infrastructure development works, the PWD was further bifurcated into two departments, viz. Public Works Roads Department and Public Works Building \u0026 NH Department. The principal function of the Public Works Roads Department (PWRD) is to develop and manage the state road infrastructure for providing connectivity and efficient transportation. It undertakes construction and maintenance of roads, bridges, culverts in the state.About Tender Public Works Department requests a proposal for the Tenders for the Construction of RCC Bridge no. 6/11 over river galwang (50.00m) and bridge no. 6/12 over river aminsep (24.00m) at kalchengpara under crif scheme (job no. pw/mg/crif/2021-22/06).Tender DetailsReference No.2022_NHShi_1206_1Tendering AuthorityPublic Works DepartmentBriefconstruction of rcc bridge no. 6/11 over river galwang (50.00m) and bridge no. 6/12 over river aminsep (24.00m) at kalchengpara under crif scheme (job no. pw/mg/crif/2021-22/06).Descriptionconstruction of rcc bridge no. 6/11 over river galwang (50.00m) and bridge no. 6/12 over river aminsep (24.00m) at kalchengpara under crif scheme (job no. pw/mg/crif/2021-22/06). 793001 : kalchengpara open tenderPre-Qualification CriteriaAs per Tender DocumentsWebsite (Optional)Click here to open websiteKey ValuesEstimated CostINR 14.31 CR.

Bicycles came to Guwahati in the year 1900 and with its advent the transportation situation of Guwahati took a revolutionary turn. After understanding the mechanism through which bicycles functioned, the manufacturing of cycle rickshaws became possible. Under the Bengal Municipal Act of 1850 an order was passed by the Government of Bengal to constitute a Municipal Board for Guwahati. In those days, Assam was administered from the centre of administration located at Calcutta (in the Bengal Presidency). The Guwahati Municipal Board after coming into operation had levied a tax on the citizens (earning Rs 5 or above) and the money thus collected was spent for various developmental works like construction of permanent roads (made of asphalt and stones), drainage facilities and other civic amenities and infrastructure. The area covered by the Municipal Board was small in dimension. Uzan Bazar, Pan Bazar, Fancy Bazar, Rihabari and Bhorolumukh--only these areas were within the jurisdiction of the Board. It is clearly mentioned in a book on Guwahati by Late Kumudeswar Hazarika that till this period (under discussion) there was no mechanised means of transport in the town. To carry goods there were horse carts and bullock carts and to carry people there were four seater Ekka Garis or Tom Tom Carriages drawn again by horses. The narrow thoroughfares and roads were lit by carbide or kerosene lamps placed at a height through metal posts. One can well imagine the days when these Tom Tom Carriages moved through the small thoroughfares of the town during the darkness of the evenings amid the light emanating from the lamps placed on the posts by the side of the small roads. Looking at the size of the town it can be safely concluded that the number of such carriages was not too many. Kumudeswar Hazarika mentions that these Tom Tom Carriages were very popular among womenfolk belonging to families of the upper class because of the privacy and comfort that it offered. During the second half of the nineteenth century, Guwahati grew both in size and population and by 1893 new areas like Silpukhuri and Maligaon were drawn into the municipal limits and the population exceeded 20,000. The commonly noticed thatched houses of the early nineteenth century were slowly being replaced by Assam Type structures. Ekka Garis or Tom Tom Carriages were the chief mode of public transport until the advent of cycle rickshaws. Bicycles came to Guwahati in the year 1900 and with its advent the transportation situation of Guwahati took a revolutionary turn. After understanding the mechanism through which bicycles functioned, the manufacturing of cycle rickshaws became possible. Within a short time cycle rickshaws became a popular mode of transport for the town dwellers. As the population increased the number of rickshaws too increased and at one point in time rickshaws became the most popular means of transport for the people of Guwahati. For students, traders and the office attending population particularly cycle rickshaws became a very practical mode of daily commute. It is worth mentioning that despite the availability of diverse modes of transportation today, cycle rickshaws have not become obsolete in Guwahati. Automotive vehicles came to Guwahati more than a century ago and the first private car owner was Tarun Ram Phookun –a noted freedom fighter and leader of Congress. The pioneer in car business was a businessman named KK Sen who had his showroom in Fancy Bazar. Eventually in 1948 the passenger bus service came into operation. Guwahati did not have the credentials to be called a city but an enterprising businessman from Uzan Bazar, Subha Baruah introduced bus services to ferry passengers between Bharalumukh and Silpukhuri. Slowly the route started expanding. Despite the advent of the City Bus service the rickshaws dominated the transport scenario within the city for a long time to come. However, as the twenty first century dawned the slow moving vehicles were barred from entering into certain roads (because the slow speed acted as a deterrent to the fast moving vehicles that had taken over the traffic scene). Nevertheless the popularity of cycle rickshaws was still high because most areas (not covered by city bus service) were accessible with the help of a rickshaw. The later part of the twentieth century saw many new additions to the city's transportation facilities. The skeleton service of the bus network expanded and it covered places like Khanapara, Beltola, Kahilipara, Jalukbari and many other areas. In fact the seventh decade of the last century was indeed a watershed in the history of Guwahati City (the town had transformed into a city in the true sense qualifying on all the requisite parameters. Also the capital had shifted from Shillong to Dispur in 1972) and a variety of small city buses commonly called mini buses too were introduced. It was the introduction of mechanically operated rickshaws called Auto Rickshaws that set a milestone in the history of public transport in the city. This vehicle hit the roads of Guwahati in the early part of the seventies. As mentioned earlier, erstwhile Guwahati was a place where cycle rickshaws were a veritable boon for the commuters. After all, the city buses could not meet the needs of the people fully. As distances between places within the city increased, a faster mode of transport (than a cycle rickshaw) became a necessity. Consequent to a scheme offered by the then Chief Minister for the educated unemployed (with a loan on easy terms), the first batch of autos started running on Guwahati roads on a cool November day of 1971. A new era of public transport had arrived.By: Bhaskar PhukanThe writer can be reached at bhaskarphukan67@gmail.comAlso Read: Some ABCs of Entrepreneurial EtiquetteAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/tom-tom-carriage-to-auto-rickshaw/","tags":["Life,Melange,Supplements,More"],"title":"Tom Tom Carriage to Auto Rickshaw"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"T20 World Cup 2022, NED vs IND | Chance for India\u0026rsquo;s top-order to get some runs ahead of tough Proteas test The formidable Indian batting line up is expected to bully the ‘Orange’ attack which is decent but not exactly menacing\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/t20-world-cup-2022-ned-vs-ind-chance-for-indias-top-order-to-get-some-r/","tags":[],"title":"T20 World Cup 2022, NED vs IND | Chance for India's top-order to get some runs ahead of tough Proteas test"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Maniesh Paul’s son Yuvann meets his hero Virat Kohli, actor shares emotional note indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/maniesh-pauls-son-yuvann-meets-his-hero-virat-kohli-actor-shares-emotio/","tags":["Bollywood","Entertainment"],"title":"Maniesh Paul’s son Yuvann meets his hero Virat Kohli, actor shares emotional note"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Height of U-turn, says BJP on Kejriwal\u0026rsquo;s bid for Gods' images on currency The BJP on Wednesday cited past comments of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to claim that his demand for having images of Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi on currency notes is the height of U-turn as he is \"trying\" to be a Hindu.

Both devices come with competitive pricing, making users pick the Pixels instead of the phones from the competition. While this year’s Pixel devices are out, a fresh leak has revealed a new device codenamed “G10,” which has the exact same form factor as the Pixel 7 Pro. The device could be a prototype model. Google Pixel G10 could be a prototype model that may never release According to Kuba Wojciechowski (via 91Mobiles), Google is working on a new Pixel smartphone that has the codename “G10”. The Google Pixel G10 is tipped to come with the same form factor as the Pixel 7 Pro – 55mm in height and 71mm in width. The device is said to have a 6.7-inch display similar to the Pixel 7 Pro, again. The screen will have a 2K resolution of 1440 x 3120 pixels. The display on this unreleased Pixel phone is reported to be made by BOE. It is also said to have Qualcomm’s Ultrasonic fingerprint scanner for security. The G10 appears to have a lot of similarities to the Pixel 7 Pro and it could be because it is a prototype phone. An early prototype model for testing Google’s upcoming Pixel phone. Although Google has already released two Pixel 7 models, there are two more phones in the news codenamed “Felix” and “Lynx”. Also, recently Amazon revealed that the Google Pixel 7a is arriving soon. The 7a won’t be a single phone, but rather a family, with at least two models. No further details are known. In India, Google, as of now, has two solid models in the premium range. There’s the Google Pixel 7 priced at Rs 59,999 and the Pixel 7 Pro costing Rs 84,999. Both are powered by the new Tensor G2 chipset paired with up to 12GB of RAM. In addition to this, earlier, Google released the Pixel 6a, which is now available for under Rs 35,000.

I was to be the temporary caretaker and custodian.\nWhen I first saw Casper, I thought of changing my mind. To be honest, I was expecting Casper to be a bulldog or a retriever but aunt Zubeida showed up at my door with one hell of a black ferocious hellhound. The mere thought of co-existing with that growling beast churned my insides. Before I could clear all my queries regarding the unlikely animal, she left with a rather 'caricaturish' smile; a smile that was odd enough to distract me from her prominent burn marks for a second. She quickly unfolded the rolled up sleeves of her kaftan, petted the beast, looked at me and said \"Take care.\"Aunt Zubeida, had been travelling continuously after her husband (who was a chain smoker) passed away. After two successful solo trips across the country, she wanted to embark upon a fulfilling pilgrimage. Her zeal to travel had translated to a fresh lease of life for her and it was nice for everyone (around her) to see her enjoying life in good health. Although she wanted to embark on her pilgrimage as soon as possible she was handicapped in her decision as she didn't know where to leave her beloved pet dog, Casper. There was no one to take care of the dog and this is how I entered into the picture. I was to be the temporary caretaker and custodian. When I first saw Casper, I thought of changing my mind. To be honest, I was expecting Casper to be a bulldog or a retriever but aunt Zubeida showed up at my door with one hell of a black ferocious hellhound. The mere thought of co-existing with that growling beast churned my insides. Before I could clear all my queries regarding the unlikely animal, she left with a rather 'caricaturish' smile; a smile that was odd enough to distract me from her prominent burn marks for a second. She quickly unfolded the rolled up sleeves of her kaftan, petted the beast, looked at me and said \"Take care.\" I nodded in alliance and with sympathy. Casper, upon not receiving the kind of welcome he was anticipating, kept on barking until his voice turned hoarse. The first night with Casper had been nothing less than a nightmare. His constant howling and vehement attempts to let loose off the leash scared the daylights out of me. However, I indulged in an ounce of guilty pleasure too as Casper's howling was giving Masand a taste of his own medicine. Ever since Masand and Nina moved in to my neighbourhood, I hadn't had a good night's sleep. I realised that having a dog bark all day was still better than dealing with a grown man aggressively shouting at his wife all night, every night. Casper was getting uncontrollable each passing day. I tried contacting my aunt but it was of no use. No matter what I fed him or how much I fed him, he would not be quiet. For a while I could empathize with Nina. One Sunday afternoon, while returning from the grocer's store, I saw Masand's door unlatched and some kind of commotion going on inside. I stood in the doorway eavesdropping and analysing every sound. After a few minutes I heard something that resembled the sound of a knife stab. Paranoid and indecisive, I reached out for the pepper spray in my pocket and pushed the door open. What I saw made my jaw drop - Nina was standing with a butcher knife dripping with blood on top of Masand who lay dead on the floor. I could tell she wasn't expecting me or anyone at her door in that particular moment. My presence startled her and we both stood transfixed looking at one another for two whole minutes. It was so silent that I could only hear my heart pounding in my chest and Casper barking from my balcony. The next few hours that followed had me doubt my own conscience. Nina and I came to a mutual agreement. I agreed to help her out with the cleaning and she promised to cook for Casper that night. It was only for the similar looking cigarette burns I have always seen in Nina's arms that (out of sympathy) I decided to cover up for the murder. Although I lost my appetite for several days to come, Casper probably had the best meal of his life. He devoured the feast laid out in front of him with much gusto and pleasure. The supper satiated him so much that it cured him of his constant barking. Exactly two weeks later, Aunt Zubeida came to pick Casper. She looked much better than before. Neither I nor Nina had disclosed anything about the incident. Stunned by his sudden calm demeanor, she said, \"I don't know what you have fed him but I haven't seen him so patient since your uncle's demise.\" Nirmali MedhiAlso Read: Coca cola with a local flavourAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/a-forbidden-yearning/","tags":["Life,Melange,Supplements,More"],"title":"A Forbidden Yearning"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"What a third term for XI Jinping means for China, India and the rest of the world | In Focus podcast Ananth Krishnan speaks to us on the key takeaways from the party congress and what Xi Jinping obtaining a third term as Chinese President means for the rest of the world.\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/what-a-third-term-for-xi-jinping-means-for-china-india-and-the-rest-of-the/","tags":[],"title":"What a third term for XI Jinping means for China, India and the rest of the world | In Focus podcast"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"India vs Netherlands where to watch: live streaming info and what time does IND vs NED T20 World Cup match start?

Right now, the group includes students who gave their final attempt in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Despite numerous petitions filed, recommendations of the Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice (DRSC) in favour of the students and the Supreme Court’s advice to be lenient; the Government of India (GOI) and the Department of Personnel \u0026 Training (DoPT) has not responded positively towards the demands of the students. The students are mobilising people to stage protests in Delhi in the first week of November. “This is about the right to a fair opportunity which is a constitutionally protected right,” says Amulya Animesh, who is looking after the legal front of the UPSC COVID Compensatory Attempt movement. The hearing for the recent petition which was filed by Sohan Kumar has been adjourned and the next date of hearing is on November 28. Other petitions filed so far The first petition Rachna vs Union of India (UOI) was filed in October 2020, demanding age relaxation and extra attempts for candidates who were directly affected by the pandemic that year. However, a bench of three judges dismissed the petition in February 2021. The Supreme Court refused to interfere stating that it is the conscience of the Government to act on it and does not fall under the powers of the Court to decide. “The Supreme Court did not wish to encroach on the domain of the executive and this was the main reason for our defeat in the case. Further, it has been detrimental also because we failed to properly present our case. The other cases were much stronger and we heard positive responses from the Supreme Court,” says Gaurav Thakur, who has been a leader on the ground for this movement for more than two years. Thakur had appeared for his final attempt in 2020 and lost his father two months before his mains exam. He has appeared for mains previously as well and was looking forward to making his final attempt count but COVID washed away his efforts. “My last attempt was washed away by the COVID avalanche,” says Gaurav. In the other cases, the Supreme Court asked the government to take a “lenient view” by weighing all factors and considering the circumstances prevailing at that pertinent time. The Court also asked the aspirants to make representation to authorities for a further chance. “Isn’t this a positive statement? We appealed to authorities so many times and got no response at all. We were forced to take to the streets late,” says Ambarish Pathak, who gave his final attempt in the year 2021, adding, “This is a gross violation of Article 16 of the Constitution that promises equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment.” The movement also has its website and it has a section which states prominent Supreme Court declarations that were in favour of the students. They are as follows: 1. Explore the possibility of an extra attempt - Vasireddy vs UOI case 2. The discretion to take any stand, whatsoever, is left open for the authorities - Rachna vs UOI 3. Authorities can take a lenient view of the situation - Abhishek Anand Sinha vs UOI 4. Directions to the authorities to re-examine the matter in light of DRSC 112th report recommendation. Background of the movement Owing to the pandemic, quite a few candidates were in an adverse situation. “About 40,000 candidates have been directly affected by the pandemic,” says Amulya, “The Disaster Management Act states that basic minimum relief must be given to those affected and the government has all the power to do so. Thus, at least the ineligible candidates deserve an opportunity as basic minimum relief.” The UPSC Covid Compensatory Attempt’s website lists the candidates they represent and they are: “COVID-19 patients, Corona Warriors, Migrated Aspirants, Aspirants who lost their loved ones, Aspirants who lost their jobs during the COVID crisis, Aspirants in financial crisis, Homemaker Womens, Digital divide Impacted Aspirants, and many Aspirants whose stories are just lost in the COVID crisis chaos”. Candidates have been staging protests since no relaxations were offered in 2021. The first set of protests took place in March 2021 following the notification of UPSC 2021 issued on March 4. Peaceful protests continued along with Twitter campaigns. Yagya Dutt, who handles the digital front of the protest, says, “We once reached more than 30,000 people and were trending as the main trend for hours. It was supported by many political leaders including Rahul Gandhi.” Yagya gave his final attempt in the year 2020 and has since been a practising lawyer. The candidates also met parliamentarians like Rajnath Singh, Jitendra Singh and JP Nadda who promised relaxation at an appropriate time. Nevertheless, the promises weren’t kept. “We also sent representatives to the authorities as per the advice of the Supreme Court but got no response,” sighs Gaurav. In March 2022, DRSC headed by Sushil Kumar Modi, MP, Rajya Sabha, advised a general two-year relaxation. The committee recommendation for UPSC's extra attempt read: “The Committee is of the opinion that COVID-19 has caused untold agony and insurmountable sufferings to many. The whole of India had come to a standstill, lives and livelihoods got disrupted and the student community was also adversely affected. Keeping in view the hardships faced by the student community during the first and second COVID waves, the Committee recommends the Government to change its mind and sympathetically consider the demand of CSE aspirants and grant an extra attempt with corresponding age relaxation to all candidates.” Nitin Kumar, another candidate from the movement says, “It is undemocratic behaviour of the government to be this rigid despite the recommendations and the Supreme Court advisories. Previously candidates were given extra attempts once in 1992 and again, another time in 2011. How come a global pandemic is not a good enough reason for leniency?” PM gets to make the final decision The Prime Minister, who is the Cabinet Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, gets to make the final decision regarding the issue of the extra attempt for UPSC. The PM is also the Chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority under whose order the pandemic was dealt with as a Notified Disaster. Additionally, DoPT is required by law to suggest a relaxation to the PMO, but the Prime Minister has the final say. Thus, UPSC is in charge of overseeing the exam, DOPT is in charge of suggesting a second chance, and the PM is in charge of making the final decisions. “Our demand is to the PM to consider this and take bonafide action in the interest of the COVID affected candidates,” says Amulya, on behalf of all the UPSC candidates who have been affected by the pandemic. So, what's the final word? More than 125 Members of Parliament have written letters to the Prime Minister requesting to provide compensation to the UPSC candidates. The students have also travelled miles and beyond to meet Bharatiya Janata Party President, JP Nadda and the Chairman of the DRSC Sushil Modi, who gave the students assurances. Amulya says, “They were very sympathetic to our demand and agreed to talk to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister.” He further adds, “We have met Rajnath sir two to three times and he said this matter can only be addressed by the Prime Minister. We have met Dr Jitendra Singh sir who said that it is not in his hands to be a Minister of State DoPT.” The UPSC is considered one of the most competitive and difficult exams and takes about one whole year to complete the entire process of the examination. “There is a huge opportunity cost that comes with losing an attempt in this examination. The government had taken cognizance of the issues in other situations and considered it for so many others. That they are rejecting ours with the excuse that it’ll open flood gates of demand sounds very unfair,” concludes Gaurav Thakur as he reminds us that many states gave compensatory attempts for State Public Service Commission examinations\nedexlive\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/fresh-petition-filed-for-upsc-extra-attempt-affected-aspirants-speak/","tags":[],"title":"Fresh petition filed for UPSC extra attempt; affected aspirants speak"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"NLC India Limited Recruitment 2022 - Advisor Vacancy, Latest Job Openings NLC India Limited invites candidates for the recruitment of Advisor jobs in India, Apply Now!\nNLC India Limited released the latest job notification for the recruitment of Advisor jobs in NLC India Limited.

A natural waterfall over the Tarafeni River, the area around it is well known for its rich flora and fauna. It is also famous for being the site of historical findings (of ancient settlements). Elephants are often seen in the neighbouring forests and whenever an elephant is spotted, tourists are asked to stay away or turn back. Of late the local government has been working hard to make the roads better and wider. Do not expect very good amenities nearby, rather be apprised that there are hardly any.Gadrasini Hill A decade or so ago, my husband's hometown of Jhargram, Midnapore, was always in the news for the wrong reasons. The pristine jungles around the town were all war ravaged with Maoist activities. Although nothing happened in the main town, it became infamous due to its association with the neighbouring areas. This disrupted not only the daily lifestyle of the people to a large extent but also reduced the flow of tourists in and around Jhargram. The once popular hotspot was forced to shutdown its hotels, restaurants, tourist lodges and travel agencies due to inactivity and losses in business. However, things have changed for the better now. Peace has again been restored in the beautiful red soil region and the local government is trying hard and fast to get back tourists. Tourism is a good source of income for any beautiful place. Therefore, new resorts have opened and the old are being given a fresh coat of paint. Moreover, new food joints are mushrooming and now the supermarket chain Vishal Megamart has opened an outlet there. About 40 kms from Jhargram is the beautiful Ghagra Falls on the Tarafeni River. For a long time we had been planning a trip there. My in-laws and husband have of course visited it; but re-visiting any beautiful place with family is always a memorable event. We wanted to leave early and return only after sunset (as my husband wanted to take pictures of sunset). But then we realised that it would be too hectic for our toddler and our parents. So we started late at around 10 a.m. I will urge everyone who is contemplating a visit to this destination to take along lots of water, umbrellas, caps and of course food. There are small villages on the way where you can get food and water but a backup supply especially with a toddler is always a good idea. Our driver suggested that we visit the Gadrasini Hill and Khandarani Lake on the way. So off we went to the hill first. He dropped us off at a designated point. There is a small ashram there. The main attraction, however, entails a half an hour trek to the top of the hill. It is the Hanuman Mandir from where one can get a bird's eye view of the whole area. The way up is very precarious and steep, full of pebbles and stones, so take precautions when you trek. We heard an incident of a child and mother who slipped and rolled down and injured themselves. Since it had already become so hot we decided not to go up the full stretch. We climbed for a while, clicked some pictures for memory and returned back. Khandarani Dam From there we went on to the Khandarani Dam that is built over the lake which has the same name. This is a quiet and pristine spot and a cool breeze was blowing when we reached. People were sitting around under the trees with picnic baskets. We concluded that during winter this place must be a haven for picnickers. We roamed around, took in the clean air, ate potato chops and puffed rice and created some happy memories. From there we moved on to the Ghagra Falls. A natural waterfall over the Tarafeni River, the area around it is also well known for its rich flora and fauna. It is also famous for being the site of historical findings (of ancient settlements). Elephants are often seen in the neighbouring forests and whenever an elephant is spotted, tourists are asked to stay away or turn back. Of late the local government has been working hard to make the roads better and wider. Do not expect very good amenities nearby, rather there are hardly any. Things can get dirty when lots of people visit but that is because people litter even if there are dustbins nearby. Because of the dry season we could not see the falls in their full glory. The gushing of the water was audible but not visible among the huge rock formations. We hopped around on them but with caution. My husband took pictures and we rested on the river bank. It was a busy place with villagers bringing their animals to bathe, children diving from the high banks, a continuous flow of tourists, birds chirping noisily, trees rustling in the breeze and dogs strolling around looking for discarded food chunks. We sat there and took in all these lovely sights. It was past 2 then and we had our paranthas, aloo dum and some mouth-watering kalakands. My brother-in-law took a short nap as the breeze under the trees was so invigorating. Sitting there we all discussed how these beautiful places in our country sides go unnoticed because of less exposure from the media. Life in and around the villages near the river must be ridden with so many challenges given the dearth of civic amenities- less access to electricity, no medical facility, not even a proper school. Yet, life goes on at a steady pace and people are content with what they have. We wondered how this beautiful place must have felt during the unrest- so unsure and insecure. However, things are changing and the mobile phone have already spearheaded a change. But inspite of this I am sure that the simple lifestyle of the rural people of India will hardly ever change. Closer to sunset we got up to leave because after that there would be no lights. Our baby boy was also becoming restless. We had a lovely outing indeed and prayed and hoped that this peaceful place remained so forever from now on.By: Gargi BandyopadhyayAlso Read: Vehicles Still Move on the Water-logged RoadAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/three-gems-in-the-heartland-of-jhargram/","tags":["Life,Melange,Supplements,More"],"title":"Three Gems in the Heartland of Jhargram"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Ban on tourists, coracle operations in Hogenakkal lifted after a month Tourists and coracle operations had been banned at the popular destination due to the heavy inflow in the Cauvery river causing flooding; the inflow has now fallen to 20,000 cusecs leading to the ban being lifted\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/ban-on-tourists-coracle-operations-in-hogenakkal-lifted-after-a-month/","tags":[],"title":"Ban on tourists, coracle operations in Hogenakkal lifted after a month"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Neeraj Pandey, Netflix team up for crime series \u0026lsquo;Khakee: The Bihar Chapter\u0026rsquo; Inspired by the true story of how Bihar's most dangerous criminal was caught, the series marks Pandey's first project with Netflix India\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/neeraj-pandey-netflix-team-up-for-crime-series-khakee-the-bihar-chapter/","tags":[],"title":"Neeraj Pandey, Netflix team up for crime series 'Khakee: The Bihar Chapter'"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"\u0026ldquo;Gave Me Goosebumps\u0026rdquo;: Rajinikanth On Rishab Shetty\u0026rsquo;s Kantara Kantara fan club is increasing day after day and how\nndtv\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/gave-me-goosebumps-rajinikanth-on-rishab-shettys-kantara/","tags":["Regional"],"title":"\"Gave Me Goosebumps\": Rajinikanth On Rishab Shetty's Kantara"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Shraddha Kapoor celebrates Diwali with her family, shares pics The Hindi film industry is back on its feet and enthusiastically enjoying holidays after a challenging epidemic era.Many celebs attended numerous Bollywood Diwali parties over the past couple of days, but what came as a breath of fresh air was Shraddha Kapoor’s intimate family celebrations this festive season.\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/shraddha-kapoor-celebrates-diwali-with-her-family-shares-pics/","tags":[],"title":"Shraddha Kapoor celebrates Diwali with her family, shares pics"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"HSCL Invites Tender for the Upgradation of Road - 2022_SQCEO_121458_1 Hindustan Steelworks Constructions Limited is Inviting Tender for the Upgradation of Road from 1. mrl-12- Damdama to Ludhua market\nThe Sentinel provides the latest updates on Tender for the Upgradation of Road and other online tender notices published by the Hindustan Steelworks Constructions Limited The Sentinel is the online tender website that provides unlimited lifetime free access to Tender for the Upgradation of Road and other procurement notices types like open tender, public tender, online tenders from the Hindustan Steelworks Constructions LimitedAbout HSCL Hindustan Steelworks Construction Ltd. provides construction services.

Treatment of Oral Cancer, Oro-pharyngeal Cancer and Nasopharyngeal Cancer are covered under this MoU. Under NOHP, the Government of Assam has taken initiatives to provide complex dental procedures such as RCTs and prosthetic rehabilitation etc at a nominal cost. These services are provided free of cost to the economically weaker section. Projects like Smile Train India, have been made available and advocated for the free treatment of cleft lip and palate. What are the latest breakthroughs (in terms of research and study) in the field of Dentistry? Can you share some recent/or ongoing research initiatives undertaken by Regional Dental College? In recent times, the latest breakthroughs of Dentistry have been in the field of regenerative dentistry or stem cell research, biomimetic materials, computer aided dentistry or use of Artificial Intelligence. Regenerative dentistry mainly focuses on regeneration of damaged dentin, pulp, resorbed root, periodontal tissue regeneration and repair perforations using Dental Pulp Stem Cell (DPSC). Biomimetic materials mimic biologic tissues with excellent biocompatible properties. Various materials like SDR (Smart Dentin Replacement material) and use of bioceramic sealers in the field of endodontics are a few examples. Robotics and use of AI has come into vogue to aid practitioners plan treatments for a more predictable and stable outcome in the field of orthodontics and implantology. Dentistry is also evolving in terms of use of technology such as Near InfraRed Imaging Technology (NIRI), CBCT for the assessment of extent of proximal caries, periapical lesions, missed canals, planning dental and zygomatic implants. In Orthodontics, CBCT is used to aid the treatment planning in case of impacted or transposed teeth. Micro-endodontics and development of microsurgical dental instruments have been of great interest to endodontists. The recent and ongoing researches undertaken at RDC include: - Salivary Osteocalcin as a biomarker of skeletal maturity. - Comparative evaluation of different chelating agents on mineral content of teeth in RCT. - Comparison between bioceramic, resin based and calcium based intracanal medicaments. - Assessment of anatomical variation of lingual foramen and mental nerve to estimate safe zone for implant placement using CBCT. - Stem Cell Applications in Prosthodontics - Association between craniofacial, shoulder and vertical mandibular asymmetry in Temporomandibular Disorder patients and its effect on age and gender - Inter-relationship of Bond Failure of orthodontic brackets and oral hygiene in 6 months of treatment - Assessment of readiness to quit tobacco among patients with oral (potentially) malignant disorders using theoretical model - Validation of betel quid dependence scale among a population in Kamrup (Metro) What are the subjects taught under the BDS and MDS Courses? Has the curriculum been updated in recent years? If yes, when and how has this update happened? If not, what is the way forward in terms of upgrading (in tune with the latest trends of dentistry) We are currently following the 2007 DCI regulations for BDS course which include 13 dental subjects and 8 medical subjects divided into 4 years of theory and clinical training with one year of rotatory compulsory internship. The last and eighth amendment was published in 2017. The specialties taught under the BDS course are Oral Medicine and Radiology, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, Prosthodontics, Crown and Bridge and Implantology, Oral Pathology, Public Health Dentistry, Dental Anatomy and Dental Histology, Dental Materials and Pre Clinical Operative Dentistry and Prosthodontics. In addition to these, General Human Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology, General Pathology, General Medicine and General Surgery are taught. For MDS, we are currently following 2017 DCI course regulations, which were amended latest in 2018. Please elaborate a little on periodontics, prosthodontics and orthodontics as these are emerging fields? Periodontics is the study of the tooth supporting structure. Procedures like osseous surgeries, bone graft, implantology, tooth lengthening, laser therapy, cryosurgey are covered. This department mainly deals with crown lengthening procedures, root coverage, splinting of mobile teeth, gingival hyperpigmentation, supportive periodontal therapy, implants, placement of Titanium mesh and bone grafts, guided tissue regeneration (GTR) and guided bone regeneration (GBR) procedures. Prosthodontics and Crown and Bridge is the branch of dentistry which involves rehabilitation of missing structures of the jaw and face. It includes the study of facial muscles, biomechanics of the edentulous state, craniomandibular relations and movements and the concepts of occlusion. Rehabilitation of missing teeth, eyes, nose and also structures lost in case of oncosurgeries constitutes this branch. Orthodontics is the branch of dentistry involved with the correction of malaligned teeth. It mainly deals with preventive, interceptive and corrective procedures of correcting and aligning teeth and jaws. It includes the study of growth, biomechanics of tooth movement, jaws, myofunctional appliances for the correction of hypofunctioning or hyperfunctioning muscles during growth, cleft lip and palate rehabilitation, orthognathic surgery and fixed mechanotherapy. Recent advances in Orthodontics include the use of implants for anchorage (Temporary Anchorage Device), lasers, virtual treatment planning, invisible orthodontics and use of CAD-CAM for bracket customization. These are among the many innovations in this field. Please elaborate on the scope of cosmetic dentistry Our smile is always the first thing that a person notices. Cosmetic dentistry is one of the branches, which have recently gained a lot of attention. Cosmetic dentistry or Aesthetic Dentistry constitutes the enhancement of the smile, face and reversing the signs of aging through dentistry. People today are conscious about their looks and wish for a perfect smile, bright white teeth and a younger looking face. It includes restoration of the broken or discoloured, worn out teeth, correction of occlusion, placement of veneers, correcting the black triangles to give a more balanced, beautiful and functional smile. It is an interdisciplinary subject including restorative dentistry, periodontics, orthodontics, endodontics, prosthodontics and material science. Cosmetic Dentistry is interdisciplinary in nature and often times the most satisfying yet challenging. The North east has a shortage of dentists particularly in rural areas and government hospitals. In your view what measures can be undertaken to address this concern? India currently has 2.7 lakh dentists catering to a population 134 crores. Till recent years, Assam State Dental Council was responsible for registration of dentists of the 7 north eastern states. Assam has three Dental Colleges; the Regional Dental College being the first and oldest in the North East region, established in 1982. Two new dental colleges have been established in Dibrugarh and Silchar in 2018 to cater to the needs of growing population of the state. These new colleges have been established with the aim to inverse the dentist-population ratio in the state. Two other dental colleges in Manipur, viz. Dental College, Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences (2017) and Dental College, RIMS, Imphal (2013) and the three dental colleges of Assam are catering to the population of entire North East India. All 8 Government Medical Colleges have a Dental OPD where dentists are posted. Dentists are also posted in all district hospitals and also recruited under National Health Mission. The new generations of dentists are educated and equipped with the latest techniques and innovations in dentistry. However, due to shortage of the state-of-the-art equipment in rural areas, the dental surgeons aren't able to offer their services to the best of their knowledge and skill. Moreover, promotional avenues for the dental doctors working in the district hospital and under NHM are very limited. Dental procedures are fairly expensive and out of reach for the common man. Almost all health insurance policies do not cover dental expenses. What are some of the measures that can be taken by the Government and IDA to make dental services more affordable for the common man? Advanced dental procedures are as expensive as the treatment of all other diseases in their advanced stages. Dental diseases can be prevented and are fairly inexpensive when treated at the incipient stages. Various OPD procedures like routine radiographs and scaling, preventive procedures like oral cancer screening and pit and fissure sealant application and oral surgeries which do not require hospitalisation are mostly covered under Dental Insurance Schemes. Various social security schemes are available to the employees covered under CGHS, ESI and Army Dental Corps. Assam Government has signed a MoU with various empanelled hospitals under Atal Amrit Abhiyan and Arogya Mitra to provide health assurance at a nominal amount. Treatment of Oral Cancer, Oro-pharyngeal Cancer and Nasopharyngeal Cancer are covered under this MoU. Various schemes have been undertaken by the Government of Assam under NHM namely National Oral Health Programme to recruit dental officers to render services to the unreached and economically weaker sections of society to make dental services affordable and reachable. Under NOHP, Government of Assam has taken initiatives to provide complex dental procedures such as RCTs, prosthetic rehabilitation at a nominal cost and even free of cost for economically weaker section. Projects like Smile Train India, have been made available and advocated for the free treatment of cleft lip and palate. Moreover, many programmes have been undertaken by the Government of Assam, and IDA too hosts special programmes regularly (by offering free of cost treatment) on special occasions.

The Indian ace boasts a career-high ranking of world No.2, attained back in 2017-18, but ha'n't broken into the top five since September 2019, just following her world championships title win that year. Sindhu won the gold medal at the CWG 2022 earlier this year but has been out of action since then because of an ankle injury. She resumed her training on Monday after recovering from the injury and is expected to return to the court in December, in time for the season-ending BWF World Tour Finals 2022 in Guangzhou, China. Meanwhile, London 2012 Olympic bronze medallist Saina Nehwal dropped down a place and is currently ranked 33rd in the world badminton rankings. The veteran player, who to date is the only Indian women's player to achieve the No.1 ranking, has struggled for form over the past couple of years. In the men's singles standings, Lakshya Sen retained his career-best eighth position attained earlier this month and continued as the best-ranked 'ndian men's singles player. Compatriot and former world No.1 Kidambi Srikanth also retained his 11th spot. On the other hand, in-form H.S Prannoy, who recently became world No.1 in the BWF World Tour 2022 Rankings, continued his surge up the world rankings as well and is now placed 12th after gaining a spot. Among the other Indian gainers in the list were the men's doubles pair of MR Arjun and Dhruv Kapila, which moved up two places to 19th and broke into the top 20 for the first time as a team. The women's doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand moved up four places to 27th and the mixed doubles pair Ishaan Bhatnagar and Tanisha Crasto reached 29th after gaining two spots — all achieved their new career-high ranks. The young team of Treesa and Gayatri are now just three spots behind Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Sikki Reddy, India's best-ranked women's doubles team at 24th.

Apparently, only sandwiches and fruits were part of the menu and lacked warm meals.The cricketers informally expressed their unhappiness regarding the food served by the International Cricket Council (ICC). After beating the arch-rivals Pakistan in a thriller of a match in Melborne on Sunday, the Indian team moved to Sydney. But according to reports from the ground, the food quality was not up to the mark. Only cold food and sandwiches were served to the players after their practice sessions instead of a full meal.The training session was over by afternoon and the players were expecting a full course menu for lunch as the given food was not adequate. Most of the players skipped the food served at the venue and headed back to the allocated hotel for a proper meal of their choice.\"The food that was offered to Team India was not good. They were just given sandwiches and they have also told ICC that food provided after a practice session in Sydney was cold and not good,\" a BCCI source mentioned. \"It's not like any boycott. Some players did pick up fruits and falafel but everyone wanted to have lunch and hence they had food going back to the hotel,\" he said.Some reports have mentioned that after-practice food included custom sandwiches along with fruits and falafe in that part of the world. \"You can't just have a cold sandwich (not even grilled) with avocado, tomato and cucumber after two hours of training. That is plain and simple inadequate nourishment,\" the BCCI person added.Rohit Sharma led India to win a thriller in front of a 90000 crowd in Melbourne last weekend and the match broke several records. They have their next match scheduled for Thursday with the Netherlands According to an official update from the BCCI, there were no net sessions scheduled on the eve of the match. But reports mentioned that India is not practising on Wednesday because the venue provided to them for practice is approximately 45 minutes away from the hotel.The International Cricket Council (ICC) is responsible for the food and lodging of all teams during these international tournaments.

The English side entered the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 as favourites, but their performances have not matched their standards. After struggling to chase a small target against Afghanistan, England lost to Ireland by 5 runs on the DLS method at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. England opted to bowl considering the overcast conditions, and the match start got delayed as well. Ireland had a brilliant start where they scored 92-1 at the end of 10 overs, but the English bowlers made a brilliant comeback to bowl out Ireland for 157 runs. Mark Wood and Liam Livingstone took 3 wickets each. In reply, England had a terrible start where they lost Jos Buttler in the very first over of the innings. None of the English batters could get going in the match, and they were 86-5 after 13.1 overs. Moeen Ali was on the song, and he smashed 24 runs in 12 balls. However, the rain arrived yet again at 14.3 overs. England were 105-5 after 14.3 overs, which was 5 runs less than the DLS score. The rain did not stop, and the English side lost the match by 5 runs. This has to be the biggest upset of the tournament so far. Michael Vaughan criticizes England for not being good enough vs Ireland Former English captain Michael Vaughan has expressed his disappointment on the performance of England against Ireland in the ICC T20 World Cup 2022 match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Vaughan tweeted that the English team were not good enough, and he applauded the bowling effort of the Irish side. “England haven’t been good enough today. No excuses at all..Ireland far superior with the Ball,” Michael Vaughan tweeted. England haven’t been good enough today .. No excuses at all .. Ireland far superior with the Ball .. #ICCT20WorldCup2022 — Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) October 26, 2022 It is safe to say that the English side struggled in the last match against Afghanistan as well where they took 18.1 overs to chase a target of 113 runs. In this tournament, every point matters a lot, and losing a point against a team that they were expected to defeat will hurt the English side. England’s next game will be against their Ashes rivals Australia on Friday at the very same venue in Melbourne. This match can certainly decide the fate of this group, the loser of that match may find it really difficult to make it to the knockouts of the tournament.

In a blogpost, Oscar Rodriguez, Vice president of product management, LinkedIn stated, “We are rolling out new features and systems to help you make more informed decisions about members that you are interacting with and enhancing our automated systems that keep inauthentic profiles and activity off our platform.” How to spot a fake LinkedIn profile LinkedIn has introduced a new “About this profile” feature that will show details like when it was created and when was it last updated, whether the phone number/ email ID associated with the profile are verified or not. The feature will be visible on each LinkedIn member’s profile page and will start rolling out for other sections this week, including viewing invitations and messages. As per the statement, “For work emails, our plan is to start with a limited number of companies, but you can expect to see this expansion as we add additional companies over time.” LinkedIn further reveals that many users use AI-based synthetic image generation technology, however, the platform’s deep-learning-based model checks for such images when a user uploads his/her profile photo. LinkedIn says that this way it can remove fake accounts even before they have a chance to reach out to others on the platform. Additionally, LinkedIn will add warnings to some messages on the platform. These messages can include high-risk content or might look like a sign of a scam. Users will also have a choice to report such messages without letting the sender know. As per the company’s blogpost, “We’re excited to start rolling out these new features. What you’ll see in the future are updates on how we’re finding new ways to improve automated systems for fake account detection and removal, plus more member features to help keep everyone safe.” The post LinkedIn: How to spot fake profiles on the platform appeared first on BGR India.\nbgr\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/linkedin-how-to-spot-fake-profiles-on-the-platform/","tags":["Apps","how to","LinkedIn"],"title":"LinkedIn: How to spot fake profiles on the platform"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"You can now tell YouTube to prioritise new features Apart from voting for the features, YouTube users can also make requests for new features which will be added to the page every quarter.

While the movie underwhelmed audiences in Telugu-speaking states, it performed well in Karnataka, Kerala, and the rest of India. Everyone engaged in the film is really happy, and it has turned out to be a very successful endeavour. Ponniyin Selvan is a two-part story. Everyone initially thought it was a dangerous idea by Mani Ratnam to produce the two parts on a budget of 500 crores split between two films. But after the Audio Release Event, everything changed, and the movie generated a tonne of hype. The producers chose their own release in the majority of the regions for this reason.The movie is currently preparing for its OTT release. This historical action drama, starring Vikram, Karthi, Aishwarya Rai, Trisha, and Jayam Ravi, will debut on Amazon Prime on November 18. The OTT response is essential for this project since it will help generate buzz for the soon-to-be-released sequel.

Nadal has struggled with injuries this year, capturing his 14th French Open title while playing with pain-killing injections to deal with a chronic foot injury and pulling out of Wimbledon due to an abdominal problem.Following his defeat to Frances Tiafoe at the U.S. Open in September he said he needed to \"fix things\" and was unsure about when he would play again. The Spaniard, who has won a men's record 22 Grand Slam titles, partnered Roger Federer in a doubles match at the Laver Cup last month before pulling out of the tournament. He also took time off for the birth of his first child with wife Mery Perello on October 8. Moya confirmed that Nadal would use the Masters 1000 event in Bercy, which the world number two has never won, as part of his preparations for the ATP's finale in Turin from November 13-20. \"Before arriving in Turin, you have to play matches in Paris, which are similar,\" Moya told IB3 TV. \"Rafa is competitive wherever he is and we go with hope and illusion.\" AgenciesAlso Read: \"I still want to play the highest level of tennis\", says Serbian tennis player DjokovicAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/spanish-tennis-player-rafael-nadal-to-return-at-paris-masters/","tags":["Sports,Tennis"],"title":"Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal to return at Paris Masters"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Explainer-What Is An \u0026lsquo;Everything App\u0026rsquo; And Why Does Elon Musk Want To Make One?

It so happened that Vicky was woken up from his peaceful slumber by an alarm tone on his wife Katrina Kaif's phone. The actor took to his Instagram to share the video of the same. He captioned the video: \"Biwi ka loving wake-up call\". The audio in the post is Katrina's dialogue from her upcoming horror-comedy 'Phone Bhoot' in which she stars along with Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ishaan Khatter. Katrina will be seen essaying the role of a ghost in the film, which happens to be her first movie after her marriage with Vicky Kaushal last year in December. Katrina's co-star in the film Siddhant Chaturvedi took to the comments section of Vicky's post and put up a laughing reaction to Vicky's predicament in the video. On the work front, while Katrina is gearing up for her upcoming horror-comedy 'Phone Bhoot', Vicky has an array of films in the pipeline. The actor recently wrapped up the first schedule of his biopic 'Sam Bahadur' based on the life of India's first field marshal, the legendary war hero Sam Manekshaw.

The vaccine, a mist that is sucked in through the mouth, is being offered for free as a booster dose for previously vaccinated individuals, according to an announcement posted on an official city social media account. Needle-free vaccines may persuade people who don't like getting a shot to get vaccinated, as well as help expand vaccination in poor countries because they are easier to administer. China doesn't have vaccine mandates but wants more people to get booster shots before it relaxes strict pandemic restrictions that are holding back the economy and increasingly out of synch with the rest of the world. A video posted by an online Chinese state media outlet showed people at a community health centre sticking the short nozzle of a translucent white cup into their mouths. Accompanying text said that after slowly inhaling, one individual held his breath for five seconds, with the entire procedure completed in 20 seconds. \"It was like drinking a cup of milk tea,\" one Shanghai resident said in the video. \"When I breathed it in, it tasted a bit sweet.\" A vaccine taken in the mouth could also fend off the virus before it reaches the rest of the respiratory system, though that would depend in part on the size of the droplets, one expert said. Larger droplets would train defenses in parts of the mouth and throat, while smaller ones would travel further into the body, said Dr. Vineeta Bal, an immunologist in India. Chinese regulators approved the vaccine for use as a booster in September. It was developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical company Cansino Biologics Inc. as an aerosol version of the same company's one-shot adenovirus vaccine, which uses a relatively harmless cold virus. Cansino has said the inhaled vaccine has completed clinical trials in China, Hungary, Pakistan, Malaysia, Argentina and Mexico. Regulators in India have approved a nasal vaccine, another needle-free approach, but it has yet to be rolled out. The vaccine, developed in the US and licensed to Indian vaccine maker Bharat Biotech, is squirted in the nose. About a dozen nasal vaccines are being tested globally, according to the World Health Organisation.\ntribuneindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/china-launches-covid-19-vaccine-inhaled-through-the-mouth/","tags":[],"title":"China launches Covid-19 vaccine inhaled through the mouth"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Shikhar Dhawan on Bollywood debut Double XL: ‘Was confident I could pull it off’ indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/shikhar-dhawan-on-bollywood-debut-double-xl-was-confident-i-could-pull-/","tags":["Bollywood","Entertainment"],"title":"Shikhar Dhawan on Bollywood debut Double XL: ‘Was confident I could pull it off’"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"खड़गपुर : काली पूजा में दिखे जीवन के हर रंग तारकेश कुमार ओझा, खड़गपुर । रेलनगरी खड़गपुर के सबसे बड़े व्यावसायिक केंद्र गोलबाजार के रिक्शा स्टैंड स्थित काली मंदिर में पिछले 34 साल से आयोजित हो रही कालीपूजा में इस बार भी जीवन का हर रंग देखने को मिला। सार्वजनिन श्री श्री श्यामा काली पूजा पंडाल में आयोजकों ने भोग वितरण से लेकर गीत-संगीत का […]\nतारकेश कुमार ओझा, खड़गपुर । रेलनगरी खड़गपुर के सबसे बड़े व्यावसायिक केंद्र गोलबाजार के रिक्शा स्टैंड स्थित काली मंदिर में पिछले 34 साल से आयोजित हो रही कालीपूजा में इस बार भी जीवन का हर रंग देखने को मिला। सार्वजनिन श्री श्री श्यामा काली पूजा पंडाल में आयोजकों ने भोग वितरण से लेकर गीत-संगीत का रंगारंग समारोह आयोजित कर समां बांध दिया। तीन दिवसीय महोत्सव के तहत आयोजकों ने मंगलवार को बड़ी संख्या में लोगों के बीच भोग का वितरण किया। वितरण में गजब की उदारता दिखाते हुए प्रयास किया गया कि प्रसाद से कोई वंचित न रहे। शाम को आयोजित गीत-संगीत के रंगारंग कार्यक्रम में शांति निकेतन से पधारे बाऊल शिल्पी भैरव दास और आधुनिक गान में रत्ना बोस व रतन पाल ने जबकि संगीत में शैबाल मजूमदार ने संगत देकर शाम को खुशनुमा बनाने में भरपूर योगदान दिया। आयोजकों ने कहा कि वे पिछले तीन दशकों से सार्वजनिन श्री श्री श्यामा काली पूजा का आयोजन करते आ रहे हैं। इसके माध्यम से उनका प्रयास रहता है कि हर चेहरे पर त्योहार की खुशियां झलके। Source\nkolkatahindinews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/kharagpur-every-color-of-life-seen-in-kali-puja/","tags":["सोशल","#Digitalkolkatahindinews","#Golbajar","#Kali Puja","#kharagpur","#Kharagpur News","#Kolkata Hindi News","#Social News"],"title":"खड़गपुर : काली पूजा में दिखे जीवन के हर रंग"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"As Nothing Ear (stick) TWS launches today, here are 5 other devices with translucent design language indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/as-nothing-ear-stick-tws-launches-today-here-are-5-other-devices-with-tr/","tags":["Tech","Technology"],"title":"As Nothing Ear (stick) TWS launches today, here are 5 other devices with translucent design language"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Sequoia India may invest $50 mn in homegrown edtech startup According to a TechCrunch report on Tuesday, K12 Techno Services which has raised more than $75 million in previous rounds and also engaged with TPG and Accel decided to go with existing backer Sequoia India.\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/sequoia-india-may-invest-50-mn-in-homegrown-edtech-startup/","tags":[],"title":"Sequoia India may invest $50 mn in homegrown edtech startup"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Chitragupta Puja 2022: Date, time, puja vidhi and significance Lord Chitragupta is believed to be the one who first used letters and thus on this day, people worship pens, pencils and notebooks.\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/chitragupta-puja-2022-date-time-puja-vidhi-and-significance/","tags":[],"title":"Chitragupta Puja 2022: Date, time, puja vidhi and significance"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"OM System unveils the OM-5, its first camera without the Olympus name OM System has launched its first camera that doesn't carry the Olympus name, the $1,200 OM-5 — and it looks a lot like the Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III, other than a few tweaks. It has the same sensor and video specs, but wears a new weatherproof body and updated processor that delivers improved autofocus and other features.Other than the new body, the OM-5 looks nigh-on identical to the past model. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as the E-M5 III has good handling with a generous complement of mechanical controls in a relatively light body. But it's also three years old, so a bigger grip would have been welcome, for instance. On the plus side, OM System has given it IP53 dustproof and splashproof protection, so you can use it in more extreme conditions. It also carries the same 20.1-megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor, 121-point hybrid phase and contrast-detect AF system and 2.36 million-dot electronic viewfinder. The rear 1.05 million dot fully articulating display, battery and single card slot are also identical to the last model. Shooting speeds match the previous model at 6fps/10fps in mechanical/electronic shutter modes with autofocus enabled — somewhat anemic compared to the competition. OM SystemHowever, the updated TruePic IX processor and better IBIS unit gives the OM-5 updated image processing, with image stabilization now up to 7.5 stops compared to 6.5 before. OM System also introduced a 50-megapixel handheld high-res shot mode, live ND mode and \"Starry Sky\" AF. Plus, you get improved face and eye detection for more distant subjects, but it lacks the new AI subject detection smarts of the OM-1. On the video side, it still shoots 4K 30p video as before, but can now handle super-slow-mo 1080p at 120 fps. It also adds the OM-Log400 Profile for improved dynamic range. OM System got rid of the 30 minute recording limit, so you can now shoot video for as long as your card or battery will hold out.Overall, it's a pretty tame upgrade for a three-year-old camera and is in tough against rivals like Canon's $960 EOS R10, which has a bigger sensor, better shooting speeds and superior video specs.

गोवर्धन पूजा दिवाली के अगले दिन होती है लेकिन इस साल प्रतिपदा तिथि शाम 4 बजे से शुरू हो रही है उदयातिथि के अनुसार गोवर्धन पूजा का त्योहार 26 अक्टूबर 2022 को मनाया जाएगा। गोवर्धन पूजा का मुहूर्त : हिंदू पंचांग के अनुसार कार्तिक माह के शुक्ल की प्रतिपदा तिथि 25 अक्टूबर 2022 को शाम 4 बजकर 18 मिनट से शुरू होगी और प्रतिपदा तिथि का समापन अगले दिन 26 अक्टूबर 2022 को दोपहर 02 बजकर 42 मिनट पर होगा। गोवर्धन पूजा मुहूर्त : सुबह 06.33 – सुबह 08.48 (26 अक्टूबर 2022) अवधि – 2 घंटे 15 मिनट गोवर्धन पूजा का महत्व : धार्मिक मान्यातओं के अनुसार इस दिन भगवान कृष्ण ने ब्रज वासियों को इंद्र के प्रकोप से बचाने के लिए गोवर्धन पर्वत को अपनी कनिष्ठ उंगली पर उठा लिया था। इंद्र के प्रताप से ब्रज में चारों ओर पानी-पानी हो गया था। ऐसे में सभी ब्रजवासी, पशु भगवान कृष्ण के कहने पर गोवर्धन पर्वत की शरण में गए थे गोवर्धनाथ ने 7 दिन तक इनकी रक्षा की। इसके बाद इंद्रदेव का घमंड चूर-चूर हो गया था, तभी से इस दिन गाय के गोबर से गोवर्धन पर्वत धारी श्री कृष्ण, गाय, बछड़े, की आकृति बनाकर पंचोपचार से पूजन किया जाता है। साथ ही गौ माता की भी उपासना की जाती है। गोवर्धन पूजा की विधि : गोवर्धन पूजा के दिन घरों में गोवर्धन पर्वत का पूजन किया जाता है। इस दिन गाय के गोबर से गोवर्धन पर्वत बनाया जाता है और उसके आस-पास गाय, बछड़े आदि की आकृति बनाई जाती है इस दिन पशुओं का भी पूजन करने का विधान है। गोवर्धन पूजा के दिन गोवर्धन पर्वत की आकृति बनाकर उनका पूजन किया जाता है और फिर उनकी सात बार परिक्रमा होती है। परिक्रमा के दौरान हाथ में खील व जौ लेकर उन्हें थोड़ा-थोड़ा गिराते हैं। इसके बाद धूप-दीप जलाएं जाते हैं और भगवान कृष्ण का ध्यान कर उनका आशीर्वाद लिया जाता है। गोवर्धन पूजा की कथा : हिंदू धर्म में दीपावली के दूसरे दिन गोवर्धन पूजा की जाती है। इस पर्व में प्रकृति के साथ मनुष्य का सीधा संबंध दिखाई देता है। इस पर्व से जुड़ी एक लोककथा है। एक समय की बात है श्रीकृष्ण अपने मित्र ग्वालों के साथ पशु चराते हुए गोवर्धन पर्वत जा पहुंचे। वहां उन्होंने देखा कि बहुत से व्यक्ति एक उत्सव मना रहे थे। श्रीकृष्ण ने इसका कारण जानना चाहा तो वहाँ उपस्थित गोपियों ने उन्हें कहा कि आज यहाँ मेघ व देवों के स्वामी इंद्रदेव की पूजा होगी और फिर इंद्रदेव प्रसन्न होकर वर्षा करेंगे, फलस्वरूप खेतों में अन्न उत्पन्न होगा और ब्रजवासियों का भरण-पोषण होगा। यह सुन श्रीकृष्ण सबसे बोले कि इंद्र से अधिक शक्तिशाली तो गोवर्धन पर्वत है जिनके कारण यहाँ वर्षा होती है और सबको इंद्र से भी बलशाली गोवर्धन का पूजन करना चाहिए। श्रीकृष्ण की बात से सहमत होकर सभी गोवर्धन की पूजा करने लगे। जब यह बात इंद्रदेव को पता चली तो उन्होंने क्रोधित होकर मेघों को आज्ञा दी कि वे गोकुल में जाकर मूसलाधार बारिश करें। भयावह बारिश से भयभीत होकर सभी गोपियां-ग्वाले श्रीकृष्ण के पास गए। यह जान श्रीकृष्ण ने सबको गोवर्धन-पर्वत की शरण में चलने के लिए कहा। सभी गोपियां-ग्वाले अपने पशुओं समेत गोवर्धन की तराई में आ गए। तत्पश्चात श्री कृष्ण ने गोवर्धन पर्वत को अपनी कनिष्ठा पर उठाकर छाते-सा तान दिया। इन्द्रदेव के मेघ सात दिन तक निरंतर बरसते रहें किन्तु श्री कृष्ण के सुदर्शन चक्र के प्रभाव से ब्रजवासियों पर जल की एक बूंद भी नहीं पड़ी। यह अद्भुत चमत्कार देखकर इन्द्रदेव असमंजस में पड़ गए। तब ब्रह्मा जी ने उन्होंने बताया कि श्रीकृष्ण भगवान विष्णु के अवतार है। सत्य जान इंद्रदेव श्रीकृष्ण से क्षमायाचना करने लगे। श्रीकृष्ण के इन्द्रदेव को अहंकार को चूर-चूर कर दिया था अतः उन्होंने इन्द्रदेव को क्षमा किया और सातवें दिन गोवर्धन पर्वत को भूमि तल पर रखा और ब्रजवासियों से कहा कि अब वे हर वर्ष गोवर्धन पूजा कर अन्नकूट का पर्व मनाए। तभी से यह पर्व प्रचलित है और आज भी पूर्ण श्रद्धा भक्ति से मनाया जाता है। पंडित मनोज कृष्ण शास्त्री ज्योतिर्विद वास्तु दैवज्ञ पंडित मनोज कृष्ण शास्त्री मो. 9993874848 Source\nkolkatahindinews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/govardhan-puja-today-know-everything/","tags":["धर्म-कर्म","#Digitalkolkatahindinews","#Govardhan Puja","#india","#Kolkata Hindi News","#Maa Aadi Shakti Jyotish Sansthan","#Pd.

After defeating Pakistan in a blockbuster game in Melbourne, the caravan of the Indian team has now reached Sydney where they will face the Netherlands at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday. Anything can happen in cricket, but this match is relatively easier than the last match against Pakistan. The performance of Virat Kohli is a huge boost for the Indian side, and if he can continue his form, it will be huge for the Indian team. Hardik Pandya also proved his utility in the last match, whereas the bowlers of the side also looked in a great rhythm. ALSO READ: Twitter reactions on King Kohli’s knock KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma are struggling to score runs, and this will be an excellent opportunity for them to get some runs in their kitty before the big matches ahead. It will be interesting to see the playing combination of India in this match. Paras Mhambrey confirms India won’t rest Hardik Pandya against Netherlands India’s bowling coach Paras Mhambrey has confirmed that the Indian team is not looking to rest their key players for the match against the Netherlands. Hardik Pandya has been handled with caution by the Indian team after his back injury, but Mhambrey has confirmed that Hardik wants to play all the matches of the tournament. Mhambrey insists that they haven’t made any thought about resting anyone, and Hardik provides a lot of balance to the Indian team. He also said that Virat won the match for India against Pakistan, but Hardik also deserves some appreciation as he stitched a brilliant partnership with Virat. “Hardik wants to play all the games,” Paras Mhambrey said ahead of the match against the Netherlands. “That is important. And we are not looking at whom to rest, there is no such thought about any particular player. Hardik is a very important player for us. He adds a lot of balance: he is both bowling and batting.” Paras Mhambrey on playing R Ashwin over Yuzvendra Chahal Team India opted to play with R Ashwin instead of Yuzvendra Chahal against Pakistan, and Mhambrey has shed some light on that decision as well. He said that they keep a look at a lot of things while deciding their combination, but the ability of Ashwin to bat gives him a nod over his fellow spinner. “We look at the batting combination of the teams we are playing. You do your own homework: which players are struggling, which type of bowlers their batters are struggling against. The other thing which works in favour of Ashwin is that he can contribute with the bat,” Paras Mhambrey added.

With an aggressive starting price of Rs. 1.49 lakh (ex-showroom), the Hunter 350 is one of the highly desirable motorcycles out on sale. In the month of August 2022, the Chennai-based manufacturer came very close to beating Classic 350 for the best-seller spot within the brand’s portfolio. In September 2022, Royal Enfield managed to register a total of 17,118 units with the Hunter 350. While it could not become the most sold motorcycle for the brand, as the Classic 350 improved massively to garner 25,571 units, it did outsell all of its main rivals including the Honda H’ness CB350 and CB350 RS as their combined sales tally stood at just 3,980 units. One of the main reasons for the success of the Hunter 350 is its good ride quality and being the lighest Royal Enfield motorcycle currently available, it does have good cornering characteristics as well. The Hunter 350 is underpinned by the same twin cradle chassis as the latest Classic 350 and Meteor 350 while sharing a lot of mechanical bits. Despite having several commonalities with its 350 cc siblings, the Royal Enfield Hunter 350 is noticeably cheaper than both of them. Compared to the Honda H’ness CB350, which retails at around Rs. 2 lakh for the DLX variant, the Hunter 350 is just over Rs. 50,000 cheaper – making it an attractive deal for many customers wanting to own a retro styled motorcycle. The Honda H’ness CB350 and the CB350 RS are sold only through the Japanese brand’s BigWing outlets while the Hunter 350 benefits from the wider reach for Royal Enfield. It derives power from a 349 cc single-cylinder air- and oil-cooled fuel-injected engine, producing a maximum power output of 20.2 bhp and 27 Nm of peak torque. The powertrain is linked with a five-speed transmission. It can be had in three variants namely Retro, Metro and Metro Rebel. Up next, RE is expected to launch the Super Meteor 650 flagship cruiser while the production version of the SG650 concept may not be far away either. The new generation Bullet 350 is also under development and it could launch in the coming months.

There was no casualty in the fire that was first spotted around 4 am, they said. The market, the oldest in the state, is situated near the fire station and Naharlagun police station, around 14 km from Arunachal Pradesh's capital Itanagar. The fire is suspected to be caused by firecrackers or lamps lit for Diwali celebrations, police said. Firefighters swung into action immediately but as the shops were made of bamboo and timber with dry items stored in abundance in the market, the blaze spread fast, they claimed. Panicked shopkeepers struggled to save anything they could as exploding LPG cylinders further added fuel to the fire. Three fire tenders, one of which was brought in from Itanagar, fought for hours to bring the blaze under control, police said. The exact damage caused by the fire is being assessed, but it is estimated to be in crores of rupees, they said. Superintendent of Police (Capital) Jimmy Chiram said the exact cause of the fire would be known after the completion of the investigation by the fire department. Shopkeepers alleged that after spotting the blaze they rushed to the adjacent fire station but no personnel could be found. Further, when the fire services personnel arrived, the fire engines did not have water. To refill the engines, the personnel had to travel a long distance, and they could come back with water only around 5 am, by which most of the market was already gutted, the shopkeepers alleged. \"The police also did not act. All of them should be terminated from service for failure to perform their duties,\" Naharlagun Bazar Welfare Committee president Kipa Nai said. After speaking to the shopkeepers, Arunachal Chamber of Commerce and Industries (ACC\u0026I) president Tarh Nachung demanded that all fire personnel on duty be suspended for negligence. It was the failure of the government that it did not set up the minimum infrastructure required for firefighting – such as water filling points, which should immediately be made available at different locations in the Capital Complex, he said. \"If this is the situation in the heart of the capital, what would be the situation in the districts,\" he questioned. Itanagar MLA Techi Kaso told reporters that the market would be rebuilt by the state government in cooperation with ACC\u0026I.

Apple, of course. While the tech giant already has iPad models with USB-C ports, its iPhones still require a lightning connector. Now, in an interview at Wall Street Journal'sTech Live event, Apple's SVP of worldwide marketing Greg Joswiak has confirmed that the tech giant will be transitioning to USB-C connectors to comply with the EU's regulation. \"Obviously, we’ll have to comply.\" Joswiak responded when asked by WSJ's Senior Personal Technology Columnist, Joanna Stern, whether Apple is moving to USB-C. But not before talking about the company's history with regulation compliance, such as making its phones compatible with hearing aids and how it had to come up with its own solution because existing technology at the time didn't work. Joswiak also talked about how the EU has been pushing for the adoption of micro-USB 10 years ago. Since part of the EU's concern was that people had to have several adapters with different connectors, Apple made cables detachable so that people can easily switch them out. The executive said the move allowed over a billion people to continue using their lightning cables instead of throwing them out and giving rise to a \"bunch of e-waste.\"\"We have no choice as we do around the world but to comply to local laws,\" Joswiak said. However, he didn't say whether Apple is only making a different variant for the European market while continuing to sell phones with lightning connectors elsewhere. He also that Apple thinks the approach would have been better environmentally and better for its customers to \"not have a government be that prescriptive.\" Apple also previously cited environmental concerns for not selling power adapters with new devices. The tech giant said that doing so will save 861,000 tons of metal and will also save fuel, since more iPhones can fit in shipping containers. Not everyone was convinced with the company's explanation, though, and Apple has gotten fined several times in Brazil for removing adapters from iPhone packages. Under the new EU mandate, Apple will have to ship iPhones and iPads with USB-C ports in the region by the end of 2024.\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/iphones-will-get-usb-c-charging-to-comply-with-eu-law-apple-svp-confirms/","tags":["Information Technology","Company Legal \u0026 Law Matters","Technology \u0026 Electronics","Handheld \u0026 Connected Devices","site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Mariella Moon"],"title":"iPhones will get USB-C charging to comply with EU law, Apple SVP confirms"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Madley to referee Premier League game four years after sacking Madley was sacked by the refereeing body Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) after sending a video mocking a disabled person to a friend.\nsportstar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/madley-to-referee-premier-league-game-four-years-after-sacking/","tags":[],"title":"Madley to referee Premier League game four years after sacking"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"BDL Recruitment 2022 - Management Trainee Vacancy, Job Opening Bharat Dynamics Limited is recruiting for the post of Management Trainee.

However, they have now put their strike on hold as the State government has partially agreed to fulfill their demands. \"The stipend should be hiked every two years. It was last hiked in January 2020 and should have been hiked in January this year. But even after nine months, no changes were made in the amount,\" said Dr Jaswanth Jangam, President of AP JUDA. He added that last month the organisation had issued a notice that they will be going on a strike, but since there was a major shuffle at the state's DME (Directorate of Medical Education) office, they decided to give the regulating authority some more time. The doctors have demanded a 42 per cent hike in their stipends from the government. The notice of strike was issued on October 17, and on October 21, the government came up with a Government Order (GO) increasing the stipend by 15 per cent, Dr Jaswanth said. \"We wanted a written document to prove that stipends would be hiked, as we could not rely on promises uttered orally. Now, we have received it,\" he added. He further said that the 15 per cent hike was very less compared to what they originally demanded, but as the GO was issued recently they were holding off the strike at present. \"The 42 per cent hike is needed to make the stipends on par with the national average for junior doctors. With the 15 per cent hike, the stipend would now be on par with the neighbouring state's (Telangana) average,\" the President added. He informed that the doctors are planning to meet the concerned officials this week to negotiate the amount of the stipend. \"We will be meeting the Health Secretary, the DME officials and most probably the Chief Minister as well,\" Dr Jaswanth stated. Dr Jaswanth stated that if the stipends are not hiked, about 4,000 postgraduate doctors and house surgeons (interns) as well as about 1,000 new joiners through NEET PG would be affected. As per a press release shared with EdexLive, the doctors said that they desperately took the decision to boycott outpatient services (OPs) from October 26 and inpatient and elective duties from October 27.\nedexlive\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/andhra-pradesh-junior-doctors-demanding-stipend-hike-call-off-strike-but-/","tags":[],"title":"Andhra Pradesh: Junior doctors demanding stipend hike call off strike, but to negotiate with officials soon"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Tribal Man Dies by Suicide in MP; Kin Claim Forest Dept Demolished His House Sanctioned Under Govt Scheme However, Divisional Forest Officer Prashant Kumar Singh said the man, identified as Dhyan Singh (45), had encroached upon a forest land\nnews18\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/tribal-man-dies-by-suicide-in-mp-kin-claim-forest-dept-demolished-his-hous/","tags":["latest"],"title":"Tribal Man Dies by Suicide in MP; Kin Claim Forest Dept Demolished His House Sanctioned Under Govt Scheme"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"ACS candidates felicitated in Mangaldai Various social organizations of Mangaldai including the premier media organization, MMC have greeted and congratulated Dr Jebin Gulnar, the 3rd rank holder in the ACS examination results.\nOUR CORRESPONDENTMANGALDAI: Various social organizations of Mangaldai including the premier media organization, Mangaldai Media Circle ( MMC) have greeted and congratulated Dr Jebin Gulnar, the 3rd rank holder in the ACS examination results.

FDI in the first Quarter of Fiscal Year 23 as per State Bank of Pakistan's data also shrank by 47 per cent year-on-year. It is pertinent to note that there has been a weak FDI from key investing countries including China, the USA and the UK. Moreover, United Arab Emirates was the largest contributor during Q1 FY23. China landed second during 1QFY23, the media portal said. Pakistan's power sector attracted the majority of FDI. It was followed by the financial sector and the oil and gas sector.

SpaceX’s ascension up those ranks has been arduous and far from guaranteed, but the company now provides NASA with a wide range of relatively affordable spaceflight services. SpaceX was paid a record $2.04 billion for those services in the 2022 fiscal year. Only the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a nonprofit that includes the entirety of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and received $2.68 billion in the same period, ranks higher on NASA’s list of FY2022 vendors. Boeing came in third with $1.72 billion, followed by Lockheed Martin with $1.34 billion. . @spacex has edged out @BoeingSpace to become NASA's top vendor after @Caltech, which operates @NASAJPL. @NASA obligated more than $2B to SpaceX in fiscal '22, which ended Sept. 30, compared to $1.7B for Boeing, $1.3B for @LMSpace. Caltech's contract $2.7B. Times are a'changing pic.twitter.com/FEBx8XC0gb— Irene Klotz (@Free_Space) October 25, 2022 (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Cargo NASA kickstarted its relationship with SpaceX in December 2008 when it awarded the company a $1.5 billion contract to develop the first versions of the Cargo Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket and deliver cargo to the International Space Station (ISS). Famously, founder and CEO Elon Musk once told 60 Minutes that, to a degree, NASA’s contract saved SpaceX from imminent bankruptcy and possible dissolution. Saved by the infusion of resources, SpaceX successfully debuted Falcon 9 in June 2010 and began operational ISS cargo deliveries under NASA’s Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) program in October 2012. Aside from a survivable engine failure on CRS-1 (2012) and one catastrophic Falcon 9 failure on CRS-7 (2015), NASA and SpaceX’s CRS cooperation has been a thorough success. SpaceX is just a few weeks away from CRS-26, which will likely become Cargo Dragon’s 26th successful ISS cargo delivery in 10 years. NASA ultimately paid SpaceX $3.04 billion to complete its first 20 CRS missions. SpaceX’s newer CRS-2 contract, which bore launches in January 2021, has 15 missions on contract and will likely cost NASA another $3.5 billion by the mid-2020s. SpaceX launches an average of three CRS missions per year, likely translating to about $700 million in annual revenue. SpaceX completed two Cargo Dragon launches for NASA in FY2022. SpaceX completed its last Cargo Dragon 1 launch in March 2020. (Richard Angle) Cargo Dragon 2 rolls out for its fifth ISS cargo delivery in July 2022. (SpaceX) Crew The second biggest contributor to SpaceX’s NASA revenue is Crew Dragon. In 2014, NASA contracted with SpaceX and Boeing to independently develop spacecraft capable of safely transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS), taking over the role the Space Shuttle and Russian Soyuz spacecraft filled from 2000 to 2020. Crew Dragon completed its first uncrewed orbital test flight in March 2019 and its first crewed test flight in May 2020. Operational launches began in November 2020. Subverting all expectations, Boeing’s Starliner crew capsule completed its first fully successful uncrewed test flight in May 2022, a full three years behind SpaceX. Starliner’s first crewed test flight is now scheduled no earlier than (NET) February 2023, while its first operational astronaut launch is tentatively scheduled for Q3 2023 at the earliest. Thanks to Boeing’s woeful performance, SpaceX has been responsible for launching every NASA astronaut (save one) since late 2020 and will continue to do so well into 2023. That means that SpaceX is on call for two Crew Dragon launches per year for NASA, whereas the Commercial Crew Program originally hoped that SpaceX and Boeing would each launch once per year. In 2022, NASA took the extraordinary step of purchasing eight additional Crew Dragon launches while buying zero extra Starliner launches. Through 2030, SpaceX is now under contract to complete 14 operational Crew Dragon missions for NASA for $4.93 billion – less than the $5.1 billion NASA will pay Boeing for just six operational Starliner launches. For its first six operational missions, SpaceX is charging NASA about $220 million apiece. For Crew-7 through Crew-14, SpaceX will charge approximately $290 to $300 million per mission. SpaceX completed two Crew Dragon launches for NASA in FY2022. SpaceX completed its sixth NASA astronaut launch on October 5th, 2022. (Richard Angle) Falcon Aside from launching Dragons for NASA, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets are also heavily relied upon to launch a wide range of scientific spacecraft through the Solar System. Since 2010, NASA’s Launch Services Program (LSP) has paid SpaceX almost $1 billion to complete six launches (worth about $400M) and prepare for numerous others. The nine additional LSP launches SpaceX is scheduled to complete between November 2022 and June 2026 will cost NASA around $1.4 billion. Five of those missions will use SpaceX’s larger Falcon Heavy rocket and represent more than $1 billion of that $1.4 billion. In FY2022, SpaceX completed two NASA LSP launches for about $120 million. SpaceX’s last NASA ISP mission launched the IXPE X-ray telescope in December 2021. (Richard Angle) Starship Finally, the last major line item on NASA’s SpaceX expenditures is focused on Starship. In April 2021, NASA awarded SpaceX a $2.9 billion Human Landing System (HLS) contract (~$3 billion including previous funding) to develop a Starship-derived Moon landing system capable of transporting astronauts to and from the lunar surface. Since 2020, NASA has paid SpaceX $1.26 billion for its work on HLS, more than $800 million of which was disbursed in FY2022. A render of SpaceX’s Starship HLS Moon lander. All told, a rough estimate of the four programs above accounts for about $1.82 billion of the $2.04 billion NASA paid SpaceX in FY2022. SpaceX was also paid about $50 million for work on its 2024 launch of Europa Clipper, leaving about $170 million that can probably be explained by other advance payments for work on upcoming Dragon and LSP launches.

He added that Rishi Sunak regularly comes to the temple located in Hampshire city when he is in his hometown. Rishi Sunak, who will be taking charge as the Prime Minister after meeting King Charles III, visited the temple in July, just a couple of days before he resigned as chancellor. He had offered a family prayer and had lunch at the temple. Chandarana told LBC News that he is sure that Rishi Sunak will come to the temple for prayers once he becomes the Prime Minister. Rishi Sunak made history when he swore his oath to Parliament after the 2017 general elections with his hand on a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, as pointed out by 'The Guardian'. And he was also the first occupant of No 11, Downing Street, the official residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to celebrate Diwali at the doorsteps of his then home. Despite growing up in Britain and going to Winchester, Oxford University and then Stanford, Rishi Sunak has never glossed over his cultural roots, staying away from beef and keeping a statuette of Lord Ganesha on his work table. \"I can proudly say that I am a Hindu and being a Hindu is my identity,\" he said in a media interview, adding that his faith \"gives me strength, it gives me purpose. It's part of who I am,\" Rishi Sunak had told The Times earlier this year. Chandarana said Rishi Sunak's appointment as Prime Minister showed that integration was working in the UK. \"It will unite the country, because he practices Hindu religion religiously and one of the key values we have is that the whole world is our family and we believe in unity in that respect,\" the temple leader told LBC News.

After losing the first match against New Zealand, the Australian side made a brilliant comeback in the last match to defeat Sri Lanka by a margin of 7 wickets. The team would want to build some momentum upon that win now. Marcus Stoinis scored the 2nd fastest half-century in the history of the T20 World Cup to lead the Australian chase. Australia won the match, but they were not convincing at all with the bat, where captain Aaron Finch himself agreed that he was struggling to bat on the pitch. Ahead of the match, Australia were forced to make a change to their lineup where Ashton Agar replaced Adam Zampa. Zampa was tested Covid positive ahead of the match, and he was rested from the match on health concerns. Ashton Agar confirms Adam Zampa’s return against England Australian spinner Ashton Agar has confirmed that Adam Zampa will be fit to play the match against England. Zampa missed the match against Sri Lanka due to Covid, but Agar has confirmed that Zampa is feeling way better, and he will definitely play against England on Friday in Melbourne. Zampa will replace Agar only, but Agar has said that he is now used to this situation. He insists that he wants to play every game possible, but this Australian team is so strong that he can just wait for his chances. “I assume Zamps will pull up well,” Ashton Agar said about the return of Adam Zampa. “He was starting to feel better already so I’m sure he’ll play against England and I’ll just have to see what happens with me.” “I’ve become used to that, I’m pretty good at dealing with that now as much as I’d like to play every game, we’ve got a really good squad so I just keep moving forwards. I’ll be fine.” Ashton Agar on having breaks between international games Agar has scalped 48 T20I wickets at an excellent economy of 6.48, and he is one of the most economical bowlers of the Australian side. He has been on the sidelines this season due to injuries, and he acknowledged that it is very difficult to be match ready when there are so many gaps in between. Agar said that he wants to play as many games as possible as it is the best feeling to play competitive cricket for the country, and when it is on one of the biggest stages, it makes the occasion even more special. “It’s harder when you have gaps and then you come back in and it’s like a whole new experience again,” Ashton Agar added.

After losing their first game of the season against the Phoenix Suns on Sunday, Tye Lue had his main men on the bench, as the Clips visited the 0-3 Oklahoma City. Both Paul George and Kawhi Leonard had a day off on Tuesday as their team with the starting line-up of Reggie Jackson, Norman Powell, Terance Mann, Nicolas Batum, and Ivica Zubac, too on Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Co. The game wasn’t much of a contest, and OKC won it 108-94. However, it raises a question on the Clippers, whether they really want to win it all or if is it going to be another season like the last three, where Kawhi load manages the whole year and they get out of contention in the first or second round. Leonard has played 111 regular season games since signing with the @LAClippers in 2019. That’s 48% of the games. — Ernesto Cova (@ejcovap) October 26, 2022 Also read: “I love Klay Thompson”: Devin Booker Extinguishes any Fires While Holding 4x Champ to 0/3 from 3-point Range Kawhi Leonard is NBA’s costliest player ever As Leonard missed the 242nd regular season game of his career Tuesday night, which would be 3 entire seasons of an NBA calendar, NBA Twitter put the Clippers star to question. Superstar Kawhi Leonard has missed 242 regular season games since 2014. That’s three full seasons. His career average sits below 20 PPG because he’s averaged 20+ for just 5 seasons in his career, none of which he played a full campaign.#Clippers — Ernesto Cova (@ejcovap) October 26, 2022 Obviously, we might never have those answers on anything about Leonard’s intentions for that matter, but this man can tell you how Leonard is the costliest player in the NBA, and how the Clippers have been robbed in broad daylight. Kawhi has made $32.7M, $34.9M, $39.3M in three seasons as a Clipper. That’s nearly one million per game played, or $29K per minute played (3.663 mins). That’s also $37.3K per point scored (2.860). What a HEIST. — Ernesto Cova (@ejcovap) October 26, 2022 The @LAClippers have won 78 regular season games with Kawhi Leonard on the court. That’s $1.37M per win. Oh, and they have zero (0) rings to show for it. Why is nobody talking about this??? #LAClippers — Ernesto Cova (@ejcovap) October 26, 2022 Yikes! No win in pro sports is as costly as that. Kawhi Leonard is a luxury that everyone in the league would afford gladly A million dollars to play 40-44 minutes of basketball only when he wants to? Why would Kawhi have this otherwise? Maybe he wins the Clippers a championship, perhaps he won’t, but nobody could or will try to take it anything away from “The Klaw”. Even if he continues to play this way throughout the end of his contract, teams will still have him on top of their priority list when his contract expires in 2025 or a year before that when he has a player option in 2024. The former Spurs man will be at least 33 years of age when that time arrives, and if the Clippers are without a championship by then, there wouldn’t be a bigger failure for a player who is arguably the best in the league when he is fit.

Hence, the need of the hour is more of survival rather than celebration. Hence, all that was required for Thank God was to take a respectable opening at the box office. Well, that has happened for the Indra Kumar directed film, though one was hoping that the film takes a start in the range of Rs. 10-12 crores. Well, this couldn’t happen with Rs. 8.10 crores coming in at the box office. Of course, this is Diwali season and hence one is bound to expect a lot more. However, things are very different post-pandemic and hence what was commissioned prior to that or used to work back in time can't be expected to open as well in the current circumstances. Hence, one would take what comes one's way. What's required though from this point on is for the film to stay stable and keep collecting. Today/tomorrow Bhai Dooj is being celebrated in some parts of the country.

The Goalpara district administration has already sealed the so-called Miya Museum premises under orders from Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who questioned the source of funds behind the project in the front press on Tuesday. M Mohar Ali has been alleged to have set up the museum that cooked up a lot of controversies and drew a brawl between several politicians. Himanta Biswa Sarma had mentioned that the police will investigate the source of funds behind the construction of the disputed museum. He also said that all members involved in this project will be questioned in a proper probe. The products on the display are related to the Assamese people and not to the Miya community alone.

Well, there is a reason why The Chuckster could fetch up to $200 million from the 10-year deal he signed with Turner, great news for avid fans of the award-winning show, which also boasts the esteemed panel of Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson.

The two are retired GMC Chief Engineer Tasdiqur Rahman and Executive Engineer Simanta Jyoti Baruah. Contractor Mithu Agarwal is also evading arrest. According to sources, the three accused evading arrests will come to the investigators' net. The investigators arrested chief account officer Abhimanyu Medhi from his Nalbari residence and brought him to Guwahati on October 22. He is under judicial custody now. According to sources, the investigators will grill more GMC officials. That may lead to more arrests. The eight arrested by the Chief Minister's Special Vigilance Cell on October 21 are GMC OSD Babulal Sarma, Executive Engineer and Swacchata Officer Ashif Ahmed, Executive Engineer (Division I) Shankar Medhi, Executive Engineer (Division-II) Ramakanta Saikia, Executive Engineer (Division-III) Alin Begum, Executive Engineer (Division-IV) Chittaranjan Dutta, Executive Engineer (Division-V) Hiranya Barman and M/s Dinsan Global Venture Pvt Ltd Director (contractor) Dinesh Jaiswal.

In its fresh ruling, the regulator found Google to be dominant in the markets for licensable OS for smart mobile devices and market for app stores for Android smart mobile OS, in India. \"Selling of in-app digital goods constitutes an important means for app developers to monetise their creations/innovations. However, for in-app digital goods to be distributed to purchasing users, developers must configure their apps so that all purchases of the digital goods go through Google's payment system, which processes the transactions,\" it said. Google's Play Store policies require the app developers to exclusively and mandatorily use Google Play's Billing System (GPBS) not only for receiving payments for Apps (and other digital products like audio, video, and games) distributed/sold through the Google Play Store but also for certain in-app purchases. If the app developers do not comply with Google's policy of using GPBS, they are not permitted to list their apps on the Play Store and thus, would lose out on the vast pool of potential customers in the form of Android users. \"Making access to the Play Store dependent on mandatory usage of GPBS for paid apps and in-app purchases is one-sided and arbitrary and devoid of any legitimate business interest. The app developers are left bereft of the inherent choice to use payment processors of their liking from the open market,\" said the CCI. Google India was yet to react to the fresh CCI ruling. India is Google's largest market by users. The CCI also directed Google to cease and desist from indulging in anti-competitive practices. \"Google shall allow, and not restrict app developers from using any third-party billing/ payment processing services, either for in-app purchases or for purchasing apps. Google shall also not discriminate or otherwise take any adverse measures against such apps using third-party billing/ payment processing services, in any manner,\" said the regulator. In relation to the computation of penalty, the Commission noted that there were glaring inconsistencies and wide disclaimers in presenting various revenue data points by Google. Accordingly, the Commission imposed a penalty of 7 per cent of its average relevant turnover amounting to Rs 936.44 crore upon Google. The tech giant has been given a time of 30 days to provide the requisite financial details and supporting documents.

This year, the day was celebrated with the theme 'Har Din Har Ghar Ayurveda' so as to propagate benefits of Ayurveda to larger and grassroots community. The six-week-long celebration saw huge participation from across the country and more than 5,000 events were organized by the Ministry of Ayush institutes/councils, with the support of more than 26 Ministries of the Union Government and Ministry of External Affairs India missions and embassies.

Chief Guest of the event, Munda said, \"Ayurveda is India's ancient tradition and wealth. Ayurveda can be nurtured in association with the people living in the forests. Ayurveda is the only medical science that talks about prevention of disease, not treatment after getting sick.\" On the occasion, Sonowal said, \"The objective of 'Har Din Har Ghar Ayurveda' campaign is to take Ayurveda and its potential to the masses. Ayurveda is now known globally and this is because of the continuous and untiring efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Ayurveda is a science of prevention of disease. It's ancient knowledge and we are doing some impressive research work in the Ayush sector.\" Lekhi said, \"It's time to appreciate the science of our ancestors. A science which is more than 5,000-years-old is celebrated on the occasion of the Ayurveda Day in the supervision of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He always promoted the science of Ayurveda and in last few years it has reached to its peak.\" Nesari said, \"The 'I support Ayurveda' campaign got enormous support from all, as more than 1.7 crore people participated. More than 56 lakh people participated in various programmes based on Ayurveda Day 2022 in six-week long programme.\" On this occasion, a book on 'The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India' and 'The Ayurvedic Formulary of India', was released.

Many people have called Sunak pro-crypto for his efforts to make Britain “a global hub for cryptoasset technology and investment,” as announced by the U.K. government in April. He said at the time: It’s my ambition to make the U.K. a global hub for cryptoasset technology, and the measures we’ve outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest, innovate and scale up in this country. The British government also affirmed that it will “see stablecoins recognized as a valid form of payment as part of wider plans to make Britain a global hub for cryptoasset technology and investment.” Moreover, the government noted that it “will explore ways of enhancing the competitiveness of the U.K. tax system to encourage further development of the cryptoasset market in the U.K.” Sunak also commissioned the Royal Mint to create a non-fungible token (NFT). “We want to see the businesses of tomorrow — and the jobs they create — here in the U.K., and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term,” Sunak opined. “This is part of our plan to ensure the UK financial services industry is always at the forefront of technology and innovation.” Sunak also said in January: Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest – but it’s important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims. We are ensuring consumers are protected, while also supporting innovation of the cryptoasset market. However, the new prime minister is also pro-central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which has caused concerns among some crypto advocates. In October last year, he explained how CBDCs could benefit businesses and consumers as the G7 issued a report on the subject. Sunak also set up a taskforce to lead the U.K.’s work on a central bank digital currency. What do you think about Rishi Sunak becoming the prime minister of Britain?

Despite his wide skill set, however, Chamberlain’s athletic dominance was his stand-out attribute. Wilt was an absolute freak of nature and his athleticism was incomparable. A 7-footer with a 48-inch vertical who could play competitive sports in his post-retirement career – that is the sort of athleticism associated with Chamberlain. Anecdotal evidence is aplenty when it comes to describing Chamberlain’s athleticism. However, what is better than getting praise from your biggest rival? and Wilt were contemporaries and era-defining centers. Their rivalry headlined the NBA and the competitiveness surrounding it during their time. Therefore, to have Russell describe Chamberlain’s physical tools is the praise of the highest order. While describing one of their famous encounters, Russell talked about how Wilt’s strength surprised him. According to Bill Russell, there was a certain play where the Celtics had one of their strongest men on Wilt. This was warranted, but how the play turned out, was all Wilt. The man to mark Wilt for the Celtics was Gene Conley. For the uninitiated, Conley was a 6’8, 102kg big man with a reputation for his physicality. However, as Russell , he was an absolute no-contest for Wilt. As Russell recalled, To carry on nonchalantly with a Conley-sized body bothering you is as Wilt as it gets. An athletic specimen beyond comprehension, Wilt the Stilt’s incredible tales stay undefeated. For most common men, Arnold Schwarzenegger is arguably the epitome of strength. However, Wilt matched, and probably outdid Arnold at the gym even. Chamberlain was capable of benching 500 lbs – an incredible feat. Chamberlain’s success wasn’t limited to basketball either. Wilt was a stud on the volleyball court and a track and field success story too. To top it off, Wilt was such a good athlete going into his 50s, that the erstwhile New Jersey Nets offered him a contract to return to the NBA. An NBA organization identified Chamberlain to be a legitimate option in the premier league of basketball when he was 50. If that isn’t proof enough of how athletically gifted Wilt was, nothing is. Wilt Chamberlain is arguably the greatest athlete in NBA history, and his claim to the title is pretty strong.\nthesportsrush\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/when-bill-russell-witnessed-wilt-chamberlain-manhandling-one-of-strongest-p/","tags":["Basketball","Bill Russell","Gene Conley","New Jersey Nets","Wilt Chamberlain"],"title":"When Bill Russell witnessed Wilt Chamberlain Manhandling One of Strongest Players of All-time"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"What does demerger of the financial services biz mean for RIL shareholders?

Stvring (@simonbs) October 25, 2022 Gambling apps are highly controversial. The apps allow players to purchase digital currency and use it to gamble in casino-like games, including Blackjack, poker, roulette, and more. Many of these apps inform users that they can exchange winnings for cash via PayPal, Apple Pay, or prepaid debit cards. According to complaints, many of these apps allegedly violate anti-gambling laws of at least 25 states. There's also concern over how easy these apps are to use. At-risk individuals can — and often do — spend more money than they are able to afford. Apple has been involved in a number of lawsuits related to digital gambling apps. Accusers claim that Apple operates as an \" unlicensed casino ,\" facilitating illegal gambling. And, because Apple collects a 30% cut on each in-app purchase, many believe that Apple is profiting directly from illegal activity.

Their discovery is reported in an Angewandte Chemie paper titled \"Discovery of the First Selective Nanomolar Inhibitors of ERAP2 by Kinetic Target-Guided Synthesis.\" They discovered the molecule -; and enzyme inhibitor -; after first studying how the immune system works and why some diseases can be resistant to treatments. Tumors have the ability to present cell-surface markers in the form of non-self peptide antigens, or neoantigens, which renders them exquisitely sensitive to recognition and elimination by T-cells, a form of immune cells that kill tumor cells upon recognition of neoantigens. The visibility of a tumor to T-cells is therefore a critical aspect of whether a T-cell based immunotherapy treatment will be successful. Unfortunately, most tumors have low expression levels of neoantigens on their surfaces and, consequently, are resistant to immunotherapies.\" Marlene Bouvier, S tudy Corresponding Author, UIC Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine For the study, the team looked at endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases 1 and 2, or ERAP1 and ERAP2, which are proteins responsible for trimming and over-trimming peptide antigens and neoantigens inside cells. \"Over-trimming of neoantigens in tumors by ERAPs represents missed opportunities to 'illuminate' tumors for recognition and destruction by T-cells,\" Bouvier said. \"As such, the modulation of ERAP1 and ERAP2 function with small molecule inhibitors offers an exciting approach to tone down their over-trimming function, increase tumor visibility, and enhance immune responses against tumors.\" In their study, the UIC team describes the discovery of the first highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of ERAP2. \"We used kinetic target-guided synthesis to discover such inhibitors,\" Bouvier said. \"We then used X-ray crystallography to reveal at the atomic level the binding mode of the small molecules, which allowed us to improve their design for greater potency and selectivity. We also showed that some optimized analogues represent lead compounds for drug discovery efforts.\" The researchers say that such small molecules of ERAP2 could be used in conjunction with other forms of cancer treatments, as well as for the treatment of other diseases that are dependent on the cell surface presentation of antigens, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.

Both he and the Ukrainian people can count on the UK's continued solidarity and support. We will always stand with Ukraine,\" Sunak tweeted following the conversation. On Tuesday, in response to the prospects of good relations between Russia and the UK after the appointment of Sunak, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, \"No, at present, we do not see any preconditions, grounds or hopes for some positive shifts in the foreseeable future.\" In a letter, Sunak had earlier praised the country's steadfast courage in standing up to Russian \"aggression\" and promising support from the people of the United Kingdom as the war continues in the country, reported TASS. In the letter published in the Kyiv Post, Rishi stated he will be a lifelong friend and help Ukraine rebuild into a prosperous, ambitious and forward-looking country. \"Your steadfast courage in standing up to aggression has given hope to peaceful and freedom-loving people around the world, and sends a clear message to despots that no matter how the odds may be stacked in their favour, they will never prevail,\" he had said. \"Whatever the changes here in our country, we Brits will always remain your strongest ally,\" he added. Sunak had vowed to keep supporting Ukraine's brave fighters and said that Britain will keep providing humanitarian aid to ensure you have access to medication and food. \"Your place in history is assured as a beacon of freedom. So together, not only must we defeat Putin, but we must also succeed in deterring him from ever hurting your people again with an even stronger, more prosperous Ukraine than stood before,\" he said. Describing the fatal attacks on civilian areas in Kyiv and other regions of Ukraine as a clear \"sign of Putin's desperation,\" the then UK Prime Minister Liz Truss had said that Britain will continue to provide vital military aid in Ukraine's fight for freedom. Amid the escalating tensions, Truss had reaffirmed her support for Ukraine and said that the country will stand right behind the war-torn nation in its fight for freedom. The war between Russia and Ukraine has escalated after a truck exploded on the Crimea road bridge, causing seven fuel tanks of a train heading to the Crimean Peninsula to catch fire.

With all his films getting an underwhelming response from the fans, all eyes will be on how Ram Setu performs at the box office. Even though Ram Setu's advance booking was less, the movie registered a good opening due to walk-in audience in the evening. The mass circuits in states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Central India are responding well to the film. As per a report in Box Office India, the film saw an opening of Rs 15 crore, which is second best for a Hindi original film in 2022, only after Brahmastra Part 1. For Akshay, who has seen 3 theatrical releases this year, Ram Setu is his best opening film. Despite mixed reviews, the movie has seen a good day one business. It will be interesting to see its trajectory hereon. Ajay Devgn and 's Thank God hit the big screens simultaneously on October 25 with Ram Setu. On the opening day, the collections of Ram Setu were way ahead of Thank God. Ajay's film started on a decent note and collected Rs 8-10 crore on the opening day. Since Thank God is a comedy, it would want see the patronage of family audience in the coming days. However, since Ram Setu is also meant for family audience, both movies would try to win the favour of the movie goers. In Ram Setu, Akshay Kumar plays an archeologist who is tasked with proving whether 'Ram Setu' is a man made structure or a result of natural phenomenon.

Global cases will increase in coming months, says new report The University of Washington's analysis also found that the new Omicron subvariant XBB, which is currently driving a surge in hospitalizations in some countries, is more transmissible.\nNew Delhi: Daily global COVID-19 infections are projected to rise slowly to about 18.7 million by February from the current 16.7 million average daily cases, driven by the northern hemisphere's winter months, the University of Washington said in an analysis. Far fewer infections are expected than last winter's estimated peak daily average of about 80 million cases in January of 2022 which was driven by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, according to the report. The increase in cases is not expected to cause a surge in deaths, the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) said. It forecast that global daily deaths would average 2,748 people on Feb. 1, compared with around 1,660 currently. In January, deaths were more than 11 million per day globally. IHME estimates that daily infections in the United States will increase by a third to more than a million, driven by students back in schools and cold weather-related indoor gatherings. A surge in Germany has peaked already, it said in its report on Oct. 24. IHME expects cases there will fall by more than a third to around 190,000 by February. The report suggests that the recent COVID surge in Germany might be due to Omicron subvariants BQ.1 or BQ.1.1, and will likely spread to other parts of Europe in the coming weeks. A rapid increase in hospital admissions in Germany – the highest since the COVID outbreak in 2020 - remains an area of concern, it said. IHME's analysis also found that the new Omicron subvariant XBB, which is currently driving a surge in hospitalizations in Singapore, is more transmissible but less severe. The global impact of XBB is expected to be muted by the fact that people who were previously infected with the BA.5 subvariant of Omicron likely have immunity against it, the report said.\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/another-covid-19-wave-soon-global-cases-will-increase-in-coming-months-sa/","tags":[],"title":"Another Covid-19 wave soon?

Whether or not Hamill has donated some of his personal wealth for the “Army of Drones” initiative is not known yet. \"I know for certain that Ukrainians need drones to protect their land, their freedom, and the values of the entire democratic world. Right now is the best time for everyone to come together and help Ukraine stand up in this war with the evil empire\", Hamill said in a statement last month, as per a report by Deadline.

Smith calls out Anthony Davis, citing the Lakers big man slipping under the radar amid Russell Westbrook bashing. Things are only getting worse for the LA Lakers as time passes post an 0-3 start to the season. As newly hired head coach Darvin Ham figures his way around, the roster looks like a ticking bomb. While Russell Westbrook continues to bare most of the blunt, some have been cut loose. One such player is Anthony Davis, who is shooting 20.0% from the 3-point line this season. Standing at 6ft 10′, The Brow is 30.8% from inside the paint and is yet to make a field goal from mid-range, surprising for a player of AD’s skill set and talent, who many regard as a top-five player when healthy. During a recent segment of ESPN’s First Take, analyst Stephen A. Smith pleaded guilty to one of his past statements on Davis. The veteran journalist had a while back stated how the former Pelicans superstar was a top-seven player, something he would take back. Also read: “Jusuf Nurkic Puts His Head Down, Rubs His Eye as Anthony Davis Shoots a 3”: NBA Twitter Notices Blazers’ Big Man Disrespecting Lakers Star Stephen A would further elaborate on how AD’s deficiencies were masked, given the criticism Westbrook had been enduring. “We need to start talking less about Russell Westbrook and more about Anthony Davis”: Stephen A. Smith goes off on The Brow. There is no denying that most of the Lakers’ criticism revolves around Westbrook, be it his shooting or turnover rate. The two-time scoring champion is a regular when it comes to social media trolling. Nonetheless, amid all of this, we have forgotten basketball is a 5v5 sport, and that there is a lot more to do with the purple and gold’s recent struggles on the hardwood, something veteran analyst Stephen A. Smith brought to light in the following clip. “I came on the air and talked about how Anthony Davis was a top-seven player. I take it back. Damn it, he don’t look like it. … What has happened to Anthony Davis?” @stephenasmith pic.twitter.com/qfEdbgeSR3 — First Take (@FirstTake) October 25, 2022 Stephen A was in no mood to sugarcoat his words, stating the following. “He don’t look like he even wants to go anywhere near the basket, and my point is, Yo bro, you too big, you too skilled, you too talented, what has happened to Anthony Davis?” Smith did seem to have co-panelists Jay Williams and Brian Windhorst on the same page too. Anthony Davis stat line 2022-23 season. Though AD’s stat line isn’t mediocre, his skill set and talent have us demanding more from him. The former Pelicans superstar is currently averaging 24.7 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 2.7 SPG, and 2.3 BPG while shooting 50.9% from the field. Thus it seems unfair as Westbrook continues to endure most of the criticism while others escape.

Despite getting rid of their All-Star pairing of Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert this offseason, the Utah Jazz is one of the best teams in the league. Starting their 2022-2023 season with an impressive 3-1 record, Will Hardy’s boys have put the league on notice. And there is one particular player who has been absolutely sensational – Lauri Markkanen. Being acquired by the Jazz in the Mitchell deal, Markkanen showed extreme promise earlier in the summer. Playing for Finland, the 7-footer erupted for 27.9 points and 8.1 rebounds on 54.2% shooting, while leading his nation to the quarter-finals of the EuroBasket. Seems like the 25-year-old has picked up right where he left off this past September. Being Utah’s go-to guy on the offensive side, Markkanen is a huge reason why the Utah-based franchise is unexpectedly sitting 4th in the stacked Western Conference. Also Read: When Kevin Garnett Ranked Stephen Curry Over LBJ, Credited Warriors Star for Changing NBA Lauri Markkanen has been averaging more points than Nikola Jokic and other All-Stars Lauri has managed to improve his games by leaps and bounds. The Finnish youngster is currently averaging career-highs in points (21.5), rebounds (8.8), assists (3), and steals (1). The forward’s 21.5 PPG is better than some of the most electric scorers in the league. Zach LaVine, who is earning $37 million this year, is putting up 21 PPG. Karl-Anthony Towns, earning $33.8 million this year, is averaging 20.3 PPG. And back-to-back MVP Nikola Jokic, earning $32.4 million this year, is recording 20.3 PPG. In fact, before his 14-point, 6-rebound performance against the Rockets, “The Finnisher” had more PPG than the likes of Paul George, Bradley Beal, and Kyrie Irving, among other stars. And more rebounds than the likes of Domantas Sabonis, Steven Adams, and Anthony Davis, among several other big men.

A squad that is filled with the likes of talented individuals such as Jordan Clarkson, Mike Conley, and Collin Sexton, all praise Markkanen for his recent outbursts. When asked Malik Beasley to talk about the starting forward’s recent performances, Beasley seemed very elated: “Lauri Mak. That dude is so cold. I had no idea,” Malik Beasley said. “Every single game he does something else and I tell him, ‘You’re cold as (expletive).’ He’s shooting, getting to the rim, dunking the ball, moving around, he does everything for the team.” Head coach Will Hardy also had a few praises for the European. Lauding his “versatility”, Hardy commended Markkanen: “We need his versatility, and we’re going to ask him every night to do a variety of different things on both ends of the floor. I mean, he’s done everything from guard wings to guard (Nikola) Jokic. He’s handled in the pick-and-roll, he’s set some screens and he’s spaced the floor. As a coach, it’s a luxury to have a player that has that level of versatility.” Going ahead, Lauri needs to keep up this incredible form of his, in order to put the Jazz in a comfortable position to advance to the postseason later in the campaign.

The 11-inch ChromeOS 2-in-1 is sleek and lightweight and the second-gen Snapdragon SoC that powers it boasts just enough horsepower to make this tablet a decent multi-tasker. I find it somewhat difficult to recommend the smaller Duet 3 because the price difference between it and the larger Duet 5 is negligible when Best Buy offers its frequent discounts of $100 or more on the latter. It’s even more difficult when the Best Buy version of the Duet 5 comes with 8GB of RAM but the BB model of the Duet 3 only comes with 4GB. That said, a deep discount isn’t a reason to purchase a device if you’re seriously not interested in a 13.3″ tablet. Thankfully, the Duet 3 enjoys its own share of discounts and right now, Best Buy has knocked the price down to the noteworthy price of $299. Coincidentally, that’s the retail price of the original Duet tablet that isn’t even in the same class as the Duet 3. Now, that’s not a massive discount but the $80 price reduction is the best we’ve seen on the Duet 3 since its debut and, in my humble opinion, it is well worth $300. Here’s a look at what the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 has to offer. Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3 ChromeOS Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 4GB LPDDR4X RAM 128GB eMMC storage 10.9″ LCD display 400 nits 5MP front-facing camera/8MP rear camera Detachable folio keyboard 2 x USB-C 2 x 1W speakers USI 2.0 Compatible Any way you slice it, this Chromebook offers up a great value at $299. One thing to note, you will need to grab a stylus directly from Lenovo as this Chromebook only works with the USI 2.0 protocol. For now, Lenovo is the only company with a 2.0 USI stylus on the market. More are on the way but Lenovo’s pen is very good and it is priced under $40 .

But compared to other things you make, it does not have that much value. That is why you should use it for aesthetic processes or mark different territories of your house. Alternatively, you can use it to make decorations for Halloween. To make a sign, you will need some wooden planks and a stick, which you can make from those wooden planks. Let us see how you can make it using simple steps. Here is a video showing you how you can make signs easy. If you need wooden planks to make it, you will need to find wood. Wood in Minecraft is found everywhere you look; the type of oak you get does not affect the sign in most cases. However, it can still drown underwater and fade out the lettering. You will need at least two wooden blocks to craft this sign. After you collect two blocks of wood, craft planks using it. One wooden block will make 4 planks. After crafting the planks, place them on the other to make a stick. You will need one stick and six wooden planks. Now let us look at the final step. Open the crafting table and place the stick in the center grid of the bottom row. Now, place the six wooden planks on the top two rows and craft. You have created a sign! Now to write on the sign, take it in your inventory. First, place your sig anywhere you want. A box will appear telling you to write on it as soon as you place it. Write anything you want and then click done if the done button does not appear, press Enter.\nthesportsrush\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/how-to-make-a-sign-in-minecraft/","tags":["Gaming","Minecraft","Gaming","how to","Minecraft"],"title":"How to Make a Sign in Minecraft"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"\u0026lsquo;एक खिलाड़ी विश्व चैम्पियन नहीं बना सकता..\u0026rsquo; वर्ल्ड कप जीतने वाले दिग्गज ने कसा टीम इंडिया पर तंज T20 World Cup 2022 के अपने पहले मैच में भारत ने पाकिस्तान पर रोमांचक जीत दर्ज की. इसके बावजूद टीम इंडिया के पूर्व कोच ने भारतीय टीम के खेल पर सवाल उठाए हैं. उन्होंने भारतीय कप्तान रोहित शर्मा को लेकर बड़ी बात कही है.\nhindinews18\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/cricket-madan-lal-team-india-performance-rohit-sharma-india-vs-pakistan-t20-world-cup/","tags":["क्रिकेट"],"title":"'एक खिलाड़ी विश्व चैम्पियन नहीं बना सकता..' वर्ल्ड कप जीतने वाले दिग्गज ने कसा टीम इंडिया पर तंज"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"UArizona researchers working on a less toxic treatment for deadly breast cancer After decades of research and two previous drug development attempts, things are looking promising for a team of University of Arizona researchers working on a less toxic treatment for a specific type of breast cancer.\nAfter decades of research and two previous drug development attempts, things are looking promising for a team of University of Arizona researchers working on a less toxic treatment for a specific type of breast cancer. The researchers have developed a drug compound that appears to stop cancer cell growth in what's known as triple-negative breast cancer. The drug, which has not yet been tested in humans, has been shown to eliminate tumors in mice, with little to no effect on normal healthy cells, making it potentially nontoxic for patients. The therapy is based on a newly discovered way that a gene known as epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, leads to cancer. EGFR is a long-investigated oncogene – a gene that in certain circumstances can transform a cell into a tumor cell. The researchers' findings are published in the journal Cancer Gene Therapy , and the team is working to get Food and Drug Administration approval to test the compound in phase 1 clinical trials in humans. Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for about 10 to 15% of all breast cancers. Triple-negative refers to the fact that the cancer cells test negative for the three other types of breast cancer – those driven by too much estrogen, too much progesterone or too much of a protein called HER2, according to the American Cancer Society. Triple-negative breast cancer is more common in women under 40 who are Black or who have a specific mutation in a gene called BRCA1. About half of all cases of triple-negative breast cancer overexpress the EGFR oncogene, according to the National Institutes for Health. The UArizona researchers devised a compound that blocks EGFR from going to a part of the cell that drives survival of the cancer. The compound shuts down functioning of the EGFR protein that acts in cancer cells but not normal cells. Often, drugs aren't targeted enough in their attack and so they will attack parts of other, healthy cells, resulting in unwanted side effects. The researchers wanted to prevent that. \"EGFR has been known to be an oncogene for six decades, and there's a lot of drugs out there trying to target it, but they all had limitations that didn't make them workable as drugs for breast cancer,\" said Joyce Schroeder, who co-wrote the paper with lead author Benjamin Atwell, a postdoctoral student in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. Schroeder heads the university's Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and leads the lab where the research for the paper was conducted. She is also a member of the university's BIO5 Institute and Cancer Center. The first two drug technologies that she and her team created worked to kill the cancer cells, but they had problems. In their first attempt, the researchers targeted what Schroeder called an \"unstructured\" part of the EGFR protein, and as a result, the compound couldn't act consistently and reliably. The second attempt resulted in a compound that was too generalized and hit a part of the protein that also drove normal activities in healthy cells, making the drug toxic. To be effective, Schroeder and her team knew that they had to develop a compound that could enter a cancer cell and target the exact right part of the proteins created by the EGFR gene to stop cancer from spreading. They succeeded on their third attempt. \"It was like the Goldilocks effect,\" Schroeder said. She and her team knew they had to find a solution that would not impact a normal cell and that would remain active inside the body. \"When we tested the drug in animal models, we got this fabulous result where it actually didn't just stop the tumors from going, it caused them to regress and go away, and we're seeing no toxic side effects,\" she said. \"We are so excited about this because it's very tumor specific.\" Like designing a key to fit a very specific lock, molecular and cellular biologists ideally design drug chemistry that will interact with the target protein in the exact right way and nothing else. \"Targeting triple-negative breast cancer has been difficult because it doesn't have one of these obvious things to target,\" Schroeder said. \"People have known for a long time that triple-negative breast cancer cells express EGFR, but when the known EGFR drugs were thrown at it, it didn't respond.\" Many researchers thought that maybe EGFR shouldn't be the target, so they looked for new ones. Schroeder, on the other hand, thinks EGFR is just working in a way that researchers don't yet understand. She and her team attempted to target it in a novel way, with success. The next step, besides human trials, is to test the drug's ability to suppress metastasis, which occurs when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body, Schroeder said. The researchers have been working to protect the intellectual property and further invest in licensing the asset with Tech Launch Arizona, the university office that commercializes university innovations. Funding for the work was provided by the Department of Defense, as well as donations from Ginny L. Clements Breast Cancer Fund and philanthropist Susan Greendorfer.

Barcelona were beaten 2-0 by Bayern in last month's Group C fixture, a result that Xavi said was not a true reflection of the team's talent. But having won only one of their four matches in Europe this season, Xavi wants his team to show their true worth at Camp Nou tomorrow. \"We have to show ourselves that even if we are knocked out (of the Champions League) we are a good team and we can compete against the best teams out there,\" Xavi said today. \"That game in Munich was a disgrace because we deserved much more. That was an accident because we lacked the final touch,\" he added. Even though Barcelona had more possession than Bayern and outshot them 18-13, the German side scored twice in four minutes against the run of play to secure the win. Barca's indifferent form in the competition has left them in danger of being eliminated early in the competition as they are third in the standings with four points, eight points behind leaders Bayern and three behind second-placed Inter Milan with two group matches remaining. Inter host bottom-placed Viktoria Plzen, who have yet to score a point, in the other group fixture tomorrow.

Paine, who stepped down from the captaincy late last year and withdrew from cricket for nearly a year, made the comments in his autobiography, \"The Price Paid,\" which was released today. Australia suspended former captain Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft after Bancroft was caught on camera with a piece of sandpaper on the field during the Cape Town Test of the South Africa tour. However, Paine said he then saw South Africa tampering with the ball in the next Test in Johannesburg. \"Think about that. After everything that had happened in Cape Town, after all the headlines and bans and carry on,\" the wicketkeeper wrote. \"I was standing at the bowlers' end in the next Test when a shot came up on the screen of a South African player at mid-off having a huge crack at the ball.\" Paine said the TV director immediately pulled the shot off the stadium screen. \"We went to the umpires about it, which might seem a bit poor, but we'd been slaughtered and were convinced they'd been up to it since the first Test,\" he wrote. \"But the footage got lost. As it would.\" Cricket South Africa and the South Africa team were unable to provide immediate comment to Reuters today. Though Cricket Australia (CA) sanctioned the three players, media have long speculated as to whether other members of the team were involved. Bancroft last year told The Guardian that it was \"self-explanatory\" that Australia's bowlers had to be aware of the ball-tampering. Australia's bowlers have denied any knowledge of the plan. Paine also denied the scheme was common knowledge in the dressing room but said the team should have taken responsibility as a whole rather than let the blame fall solely on the three players. \"Everyone was a part of it to some degree — would it have worked out better for those three players if we had owned it as a team? I think it would have,\" he said. Abandoned Paine also wrote that he felt pressured to resign from the Test captaincy by a public relations consultant employed by CA. Paine stepped down in the wake of revelations he had been investigated by CA's integrity unit in 2018 over a 'sexting' scandal involving a former Cricket Tasmania staffer. Though Paine was cleared by the investigation, he said he felt \"abandoned\" by CA once the story became public. — Reuters\ntribuneindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/former-australia-skipper-tim-paine-accuses-south-africa-of-ball-tampering/","tags":[],"title":"Former Australia skipper Tim Paine accuses South Africa of ball-tampering"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Sultan of Johor Cup: India bounce back with 5-1 victory Johor Bahru (Malaysia), October 25 The Indian junior men's hockey team returned to winning ways, beating Japan 5-1 at the Sultan of Johor Cup here today.

After a delayed start, India got out of the blocks quickly. Uttam beat the Japanese goalkeeper following a spell of domination. And even though Japan threatened with a couple of penalty corners, India's defence did not allow them much space. India absorbed the pressure from Japan, before Rohit fired home a penalty corner to give his side a 2-0 lead. Japan pulled one back through Saeki, who converted a penalty corner. In the second quarter, both teams traded blows in the first few minutes before India regained their two-goal lead as Purty found the back of the net with a crisp shot from the top of the circle. India started brightly in the second half, as Dhami added a fourth. Japan earned a fifth penalty corner, but a bad trap allowed the Indian defence to clear their lines. Japan did step it up in the final minutes of the quarter, but India kept them out, maintaining the three-goal lead. In need of a quick goal in the final quarter, Japan went on the attack from the start, but India dug deep and controlled the situation well. Having dealt with the initial flurry of attacks, India stepped up the ante and Lakra converted a penalty corner. India will take on Australia in their fourth game tomorrow.

The regulator has also directed the company to cease and desist from unfair business practices and modify its conduct within a defined timeline. The CCI found if app developers do not comply with the policy of using Google Play's Billing System (GPBS), they are not permitted to list their apps on the Play Store. This access policy is \"one-sided and arbitrary and devoid of any legitimate business interest,\" it said. Based on its probe, the CCI found that mandatory usage of GPBS constituted the imposition of an unfair condition on app developers. Thus, Google is found to be in violation of the provisions of Section 4(2)(a)(i) of the Competition Act. The CCI also found Google was not using GPBS for its own YouTube. This amounted to discriminatory conditions as YouTube is not paying the service fee imposed on other apps covered in the GPBS requirements. The mandatory imposition of GPBS disturbed innovation incentives. It also led to denial of market access.

Let's find out the benefits of walking these many steps a day.\nYou add another stone to the wall protecting your health when you walk 10,000 steps each day. Achieving 10,000 steps per day has become somewhat of a national obsession now that digital pedometers are suddenly widely available on fitness trackers, smartphones, and smartwatches. Even though it might appear silly to be pacing in your living room late at night to complete the final 100 steps, this is not just a game. Here are a few benefits that 10000 steps can do to your health apart from weight loss- 1. Strengthen your heart The difference between someone who walks 1,000 steps per day and someone who walks 10,000 steps per day is their stroke volume, or how much blood their heart pumps per beat. Greater aerobic capability is indicated by a larger stroke volume, indicating a mortality and disease risk. 2. Could help stabilize your blood sugar The blood sugar levels and insulin response after a meal will be significantly reduced in people who walk 10,000 steps each day. The person who is inactive will receive a far greater response. One who experiences a spike in sugar and insulin after eating is also more likely to get cardiovascular disease in the future. 3. Improves brain's performance Daily moderate exercise helps people learn new skills, develop new brain cells, and protect against cognitive loss. Walking and other aerobic exercises may also encourage the hippocampus, the region of the brain that controls emotion and memory, to generate new cells. 4. Reduces body fat storage Calories eaten by someone who gets 10,000 steps a day do not travel the same path when they’re consumed by an inactive person. Compared to an inactive individual, someone who exercises frequently consumes food that is utilised by the body to power important systems in a different way. However, those calories are more likely to be stored as fat, in the muscle, or in the liver in someone who is habitually inactive resulting in gaining less weight even with heavy calorie consumption. 5. Reinforces healthy habits Strength of will is the one distinction between a stepper and a non-stepper that cannot be detected by a glucose metre, brain scan, or electron microscope. Small victories reinforce one another. It is more likely that someone who reached 10,000 steps the day before and yesterday to do so again the following day.

The announcements came hours after Adidas terminated its relationship with the rapper, who now is known as Ye. Brown's decision came one day after he told The Boston Globe he would remain with Donda Sports despite the fact he didn't condone Ye's remarks. \"In the past 24 hours, I've been able to reflect and better understand how my previous statements lack clarity in expressing my stance against recent insensitive public remarks and actions,\" Brown said Tuesday in a statement he released via Twitter. \"For that, I apologize. And in this, I seek to be as clear as possible. I have always, and will always, continue to stand strongly against any antisemitism, hate speech, misrepresentation, and oppressive rhetoric of any kind. \"In light of that, after sharing in conversations, I now recognize that there are times when my voice and my position can't coexist in spaces that don't correspond with my stance or my values. And, for that reason, I am terminating my association with Donda Sports.\" Donald announced around the same time that his family would leave Donda Sports, saying that Ye's remarks \"are the exact opposite of how we choose to live our lives and raise our children.\" \"As parents and members of society, we felt a responsibility to send a clear message that hateful words and actions have consequences and that we must do better as human beings,\" Donald wrote in his statement via Twitter. \"We do not feel our beliefs, voices and actions belong anywhere near a space that misrepresents and oppresses people of any background, ethnicity or race. We've had the pleasure of working with many incredible people along the way and hope to continue to use our platform to uplift and support other families, children and communities through positive outreach.\" Brown and Donald signed with Donda Sports in May. Earlier Tuesday, Adidas announced it would be formally cutting ties with Ye, who had developed a hugely lucrative clothing and apparel partnership with the company. \"Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech,\" the company said in a statement Tuesday. \"Ye's recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness.\" As part of its statement, Adidas said it would lose roughly $250 million this year in net income as a result of breaking away from its partnership with Ye, but that doing so was necessary in the wake of antisemitic comments he has made in recent weeks. Ye has made controversial remarks in the past on a variety of issues, including on slavery and COVID-19 vaccines. Earlier this month, Ye posted on Twitter that he would soon go \"death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,\" an apparent reference to the U.S. defense readiness condition scale known as DEFCON. He was suspended from both Twitter and Instagram. His recent string of antisemitic comments has caused several companies to break ties with the rapper or his various business lines. Creative Artists Agency, Balenciaga, Gap and Foot Locker are among others which have ended their partnerships with him.\nespn\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/celts-brown-rams-donald-leaving-yes-agency/","tags":[],"title":"Celts' Brown, Rams' Donald leaving Ye's agency"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"Overexpression of KIF11 gene may offset Alzheimer’s-related cognitive decline in mice and humans The overexpression of a gene tied to cell division and the structure and function of neurons may prevent and protect against cognitive decline in both mice and humans with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), according to a new study by scientists at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.\nThe overexpression of a gene tied to cell division and the structure and function of neurons may prevent and protect against cognitive decline in both mice and humans with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), according to a new study by scientists at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. The gene, Kinesin-5 or KIF11, does this despite the presence of amyloid beta (Abeta), the main component of plaques in the brains of those with AD. Scientists have traditionally targeted the plaques when looking for treatments for the fatal disease. In this case, they went around them. The study was published online last week in the journal iScience. Overexpressing KIF11 in mice did not affect the amyloid levels in the brain. Yet they were still cognitively normal despite the plaques. This is one of the best indications that you can maintain cognition without getting rid of the plaques.” Huntington Potter, PhD, study’s co-senior author, professor of neurology and director of the University of Colorado Alzheimer’s and Cognition Center and of Alzheimer’s research at the Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado School of Medicine KIF11 is a motor protein best known for its role in mitosis or cell division in non-neuronal cells. But it also plays a critical role in the formation of the dendrites and dendritic spines of neurons, which are used to communicate with other neurons and are important for learning and memory. Yet the main component of Alzheimer’s plaques, Abeta, can inhibit KIF11 and cause damage to these structures. The researchers found that overexpressing the gene in mice with AD led to improved performance on cognitive tests compared to AD mice with normal levels of KIF11. Then they analyzed genetic data from human AD patients provided by the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) at Rush University in Chicago. They wanted to know if naturally occurring variations in KIF11 levels correlated with better cognitive performance in adults with or without amyloid plaques. “Our results from analyzing the human data indicate that higher levels of KIF11 correlate with better cognitive performance in a cohort of older adults with amyloid pathology,” said the study’s lead author Esteban Lucero, PhD, from the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “Thus, our results suggest that higher KIF11 expression levels may partially prevent cognitive loss during the course of AD in humans, which aligns with our findings regarding the role of KIF11 in animal models of AD,” Lucero said. Potter and co-senior author Heidi Chial, PhD, assistant professor of neurology and director of grant strategy and development at the University of Colorado Alzheimer’s and Cognition Center, said this information paves the way for researchers to begin testing new or existing drugs that can safely create this effect in humans. “Many current experimental treatments for AD have focused on reducing Abeta production or on increasing the clearance of Abeta plaques,” Chial said. “Most of these approaches have failed to prevent or reverse cognitive decline in clinical trials. Clearly, alternative approaches to the development of AD therapeutics are needed.” The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Global Down Syndrome Foundation and private philanthropists.

Findings from the multicenter EXTEND trial were presented today at the 2022 American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting. At a median follow-up of 22.1 months, the median PFS had not yet been reached in men who received the combination therapy, suggesting a significant improvement over the median PFS of 15.8 months in men who received only hormone therapy. The combination was well-tolerated and lengthened the period men could maintain a break from hormone therapy without progression, suggesting this approach could improve the quality of life for men with advanced prostate cancer. We know that radiation technology has evolved to directly target metastases, to reduce side effects and to better treat men with prostate cancer. This study provides much needed data on the benefits of combining these newer radiation techniques with hormone therapy to improve outcomes.\" Chad Tang, M.D., P rincipal Investigator, A ssociate Professor of Radiation Oncology Metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) involves direct local treatment of metastatic lesions through surgery or radiation, with the goal of killing all cancer cells in that location. Metastatic prostate cancer generally is treated with systemic therapies, the most common of which is continuous hormone therapy. Using MDT to treat patients with oligometastatic disease has increased in recent years. Oligometastatic cancer, which is defined as five or fewer metastases seen on imaging, represents a transitional state between localized and widespread metastatic disease. The first study showing benefit with definitive local therapy was conducted at MD Anderson and published in 2016. Since then, there has been substantial research in this area. However, despite data supporting the benefits of upfront hormone therapy and its synergy with radiation treatment, there have been no randomized trials testing this combination for patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer. EXTEND is a Phase II randomized basket trial for multiple solid tumors testing whether the addition of MDT improves PFS for patients with oligometastatic cancer. PFS was prespecified to be independently assessed and reported at 41 progression events, which occurred after a median follow-up of 22.1 months. The prostate cancer cohort randomized 87 men to receive either radiation plus intermittent hormone therapy or hormone therapy alone. Most participants (72 patients) were white, with seven Black patients, six Hispanic patients and two other patients included. Hormone therapy consisted of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist with or without a second-generation androgen-receptor targeting agent. The benefits of MDT were preserved across patients regardless of whether they received a newer generation androgen-blocking agent. A planned hormone therapy break occurred six months after enrollment, and all men resumed hormone therapy at progression. As a secondary endpoint, researchers also monitored the time that men could maintain normal testosterone levels while on their hormone therapy break. Adding MDT prolonged the time to progression; the median was not reached in the combination group, while the median time to progression was 6.1 months in men who received hormone therapy alone. These findings indicate that a strategy of radiation therapy and intermittent hormone therapy can maximize the time a man can safely maintain normal testosterone levels, which can preserve the patient's quality of life. The treatment was well-tolerated, with three grade 3 toxicities observed in each arm. These consisted of impaired muscle motion as well as urinary and gastrointestinal side effects, but all were easily managed. \"This study shows that the combination of metastasis-directed radiation and intermittent hormone therapy significantly improved progression free-survival, with manageable toxicities, for patients with oligometastatic disease,\" Tang said. \"I am encouraged that this data, combined with knowledge gained in future trials, will allow us to safely preserve a man's quality of life following this diagnosis.\" The researchers also performed exploratory analyses on clinical samples, including flow cytometry and T-cell receptor sequencing, from peripheral blood at baseline and three months follow-up. Their data demonstrated increases in markers of T cell activation, proliferation and clonal expansion specifically in the combined therapy arm. Additional research is needed to better understand these findings and to identify biomarkers to predict which men will benefit from this treatment combination. A large randomized trial is needed to directly compare continuous hormone therapy to scheduled breaks from the treatment. University of Texas M. D.

The findings were published October 11, 2022 in the journal Cancer Immunology Research [ https://doi.org/10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-21-1075 ]. The study involved a twist on a type of therapy that uses immune cells known as CAR T cells . CAR T cells in current clinical use are engineered to recognize cancer cells directly and have successfully treated several blood cancers. But there have been challenges that prevent their effective use in many solid tumors. Most solid tumors are heavily infiltrated by a different type of immune cell called macrophages. Macrophages help tumors grow by blocking the entry of T cells into tumor tissue, which prevents CAR T cells and the patient's own T cells from destroying the cancer cells. To tackle this immune suppression at the source, the researchers engineered T cells to make a \"chimeric antigen receptor\" (CAR) that recognizes a molecule on the surface of macrophages. When these CAR T cells encountered a tumor macrophage, the CAR T cell became activated and killed the tumor macrophage. Treatment of mice bearing ovarian, lung, and pancreatic tumors with these macrophage-targeting CAR T cells reduced the number of tumor macrophages, shrunk the tumors, and extended their survival. The killing of tumor macrophages allowed the mouse's own T cells to access and kill the cancer cells. The investigators further demonstrated that this anti-tumor immunity was driven by release of the cytokine interferon-gamma-;a molecule involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses-;from the CAR T cells. Our initial goal was just to use the CAR T cells to kill the immunosuppressive macrophages, but we discovered they were also boosting tumor immunity by releasing this powerful immune-boosting molecule. It was a one-two punch from this single treatment.\" Brian Brown, PhD, Senior Author, Director of the Icahn Genomics Institute and Associate Director of the Marc and Jennifer Lipschultz Precision Immunology Institute (PrIISM) at Icahn Mount Sinai Shifting the sights of CARs from cancer cells to tumor macrophages potentially addresses another key barrier to the successful elimination of solid tumors with CAR T cells. There are very few proteins found exclusively on cancer cells and not on healthy tissues that can be used to target cancer cells in solid tumors directly without damaging the healthy tissue. The macrophages found in tumors that suppress immunity are very similar across different types of cancer and very different from macrophages in healthy tissues. This has led to an interest in macrophage-depleting agents for cancer therapy, but approaches developed to date have had limited success in clinical trials. \"Our molecular studies of human tumors have revealed macrophage subsets present in human tumors and not in normal tissues and are similar across tumors and across patients. So macrophage-targeting CAR T cells could be a broad way to target different types of solid tumors and improve immunotherapy,\" said Miriam Merad, MD, PhD, co-senior author of the study, and Director of PrIISM. Next, the researchers are working on tumor macrophage-specific CAR and generating humanized versions of the genetic instructions, so that they can be introduced into cancer patients' own T cells.

Currently, researchers often have to choose between publishing and science.\nEnlarge / With physical subscriptions becoming increasingly irrelevant, researchers will have to pay more to get their research published. Xu Wu / Getty Images reader comments 18 with 15 posters participating Share this story Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit In August, the US government announced that it was adopting a policy requiring that all the research it funded is open access. A key element of this plan is that, once the policy takes effect, every research paper that results from this research must be open access the day of its publication. That means anyone can view the research—no journal subscription or one-time payment required. That, obviously, could pose problems for the academic publishing business, which depends heavily on subscriptions as things are currently structured. To adapt to the inevitable future, many publishers have been adopting \"article processing charges\" (APCs), or fees paid by the people publishing the paper for the privilege of doing so. All of this is raising an awkward question: Who's going to pay the APCs? On Tuesday, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) released a survey of researchers that suggests some are already struggling to find the cash to cover APCs, and in some cases, are taking it out of budgets that would otherwise pay for scientific work. Paying the price Research journals have a long history of charging fees for publication, going back to the days of what was called \"page charges\" in the days of print (fees for printing color images were also common). Combined with income from subscriptions and sometimes advertising, these offset the costs of the printing and the editors who arranged for peer review and typically left publishers with a healthy profit. For many journals, these charges have gone away with the growth of online journal access, but there was a history of fees for publication that influenced to development of APCs Advertisement As open-access journals were formed, they faced an obvious challenge: why would anyone pay for a subscription if the articles could be freely downloaded? As far as I'm aware, all of them turned to APCs as a solution. These needed to perform the same function as subscriptions—covering costs and leaving a profit—and so needed to be substantially higher than the fees previously charged to authors. Many journals that remain subscription-based have also adopted an option where researchers could have their papers made available via open access in return for an APC. The challenge is how these APCs get paid. A number of foundations that support biomedical research have policies that enable them to pay the APCs on behalf of the researchers they fund. But many more researchers receive funding from government organizations like the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation. To find out how they were managing, the AAAS did a survey of US-based researchers, receiving over 400 responses. Those responses revealed a variety of problems. Where's the money come from? Even before the federal government's open-access mandate kicks in, most of the researchers surveyed (over 60 percent) had already paid APCs, over a third of them having done so multiple times. But when it came to planning for the APC charges they faced, the numbers were roughly reversed, with 63 percent of the researchers saying they hadn't budgeted anything for the fees. Given that, it's not surprising that, when it came time to pay, only 10 percent or so found the process easy. The vast majority (70 percent) took at least some of the money out of grants. About a third managed to get at least some support from their department, and about half that number managed to get funds from elsewhere in the university. Strikingly, 15 percent said they paid some of the APCs using their own money. (Numbers add up to greater than 100 percent because researchers either paid a single fee using multiple sources, or used different sources when paying more than one APC.) Advertisement The problem is that grants do not have a separate category of funding to cover APCs. As such, publishing will compete with other potential uses of the grant money: research. Nearly 80 percent of the researchers who responded said that the money for the APC would otherwise have gone to buying equipment or materials. About a third said that the APC took away from money that would otherwise have paid grad students or technicians. Another big sacrifice? Costs associated with attending conferences, which were cited by 60 percent of the researchers. The total number of people responding is fairly small, and not everyone answered each question, so it's difficult to know how widespread these problems are. But the issues themselves are completely predictable, given that most labs are run entirely off a single pile of money that has to pay off research and publications. And these problems, even if anecdotal, are taking place before open access becomes mandatory. The obvious solution is to have agencies allocate some additional money to the researchers they fund to cover the cost of publishing. But this would simply shift the problem upstream, as the agencies would have to find that money elsewhere in the budget—which probably means funding less research unless they can get a budget increase dedicated to this issue. In any case, the authors of the AAAS report paint the problem very clearly: \"We face a growing risk that the ability to pay APCs—rather than the merits of the research—will determine what and who gets published.\"\narstechnica\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/the-feds-new-open-access-policy-whos-gonna-pay-for-it/","tags":["Science","Science","Science policy","Scientific publishing"],"title":"The feds’ new open-access policy: Who’s gonna pay for it?"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Afghanistan vs New Zealand Live Streaming Info, T20 World Cup: When and where to watch AFG vs NZ Super 12 match?

Also Read: Thankfully, any fans that may be panicking can take a deep breath. Indeed, PG13 was deemed unfit to play. However, as per ESPN, it is only due to a non-Covid related illness.

In all likelihood, it will only be a couple of games before fans are treated to him on the court alongside Kawhi Leonard and John Wall once again. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer went all in for a reason, right? As they are right now, the less acknowledged LA team most certainly ticks all the boxes needed for a championship team. However, there’s just one problem. The Western Conference is far stronger than it has been in a long time. The upper echelon may only consist of the Warriors, Clippers, and the Suns. However, the list of challengers is absolutely massive. Ja Morant’s Grizzlies, Luka Doncic’s Mavericks, Nikola Jokic, and his Nuggets.

Citing a “dangerous and volatile environment” for the global economy, including the surge in energy prices and increased volatility in financial markets, Yellen warned that in the United States: Financial stability risks could materialize. “We are closely monitoring the financial sector, as global developments have led to increased market volatility,” Yellen added. “To date, the U.S. financial system has not been a source of economic instability. While we continue to watch for emerging risks, our system remains resilient and continues to operate well through uncertainties.” Yellen on U.S. Economy and Inflation Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also talked about the U.S. economy and inflation in her speech at the SIFMA annual meeting Monday. While noting that “The U.S. economy retains significant strength,” she cautioned: Inflation remains too high, and we are contending with serious global headwinds. “Growth is slowing globally. And energy and food prices have risen, driven partly by Putin’s terrible war in Ukraine and the pandemic’s lingering effects abroad. Climate change continues to devastate communities, exacerbating energy and food shortages in Europe and across the world,” the treasury secretary continued. “We are highly attuned to these risks.” What do you think about the comments by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen?

The company has re-launched its Pink membership at $10 per month or $99 per year, or about half the previous price. You lose the discounts on all rides. Instead, the focus is on perks that may save you money in the long run. You now get free priority pickups that, according to Lyft, save an average of $3 to $4 per trip. You'll also receive \"at least\" a 5 percent discount on Preferred, Lux and XL rides, three free cancellations per month, a free bike or scooter unlock each month, free Sixt car rental upgrades, GrubHub+ discounts and roadside assistance for your own car up to four times every year.The company still hopes you'll pay more. For $199 per year, Lyft Pink All Access includes unlimited 45-minute \"classic\" bike rides, unlimited e-bike and scooter unlocks (with discounted rates) and three yearly bike or scooter guest passes. If you regularly get around town on two wheels, this could represent a significant savings.Drivers still get paid the same regardless of your discounts, Lyft says. You'll also receive a discount on rides if priority pickups aren't available when you book. Bike and scooter bonuses aren't available everywhere, however. You'll need to use them in a handful of US cities, including Denver, Los Angeles and New York City.There's no mystery behind the reasons for the Pink re-do. This is Lyft's answer to Uber One, which costs the same $10 per month and shares the focus on \"priority\" service. Where Uber splits its attention between ridesharing and food deliveries, though, Lyft concentrates on transportation. Whichever service suits your tastes, the goal is the same — this is meant to ensure your loyalty while providing a recurring boost to the company's bottom line.\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/lyfts-re-launched-pink-subscription-starts-at-10-per-month/","tags":["Automotive Industry","site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Jon Fingas"],"title":"Lyft's re-launched Pink subscription starts at $10 per month"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"\u0026lsquo;I could have died\u0026rsquo; says Apple Watch-wearing doctor who took a hard fall Dr. Thomas Ficho shared a story of how his Apple Watch automatically contacted emergency services after a home improvement mishap with the device's Fall Detection feature.Apple Watch Series 5Fico was wearing his Apple Watch while he power-washed his house.

His last film, Total Dhamaal, right before the pandemic in 2019, was a hit too. The Ajay Devgn-Sidharth Malhotra-Rakul Preet Singh starrer has all the elements of formula hit ndash; Maa hai, bahan bhi, jute marne wala baap bhi, giving and caring wife and a hero with too many flaws. Interestingly, plot bhi hai, duly tampered with a sizzling item number by Nora Fatehi. The story follows a real estate tycoon Ayaan Kapoor (Sidharth Malhotra), who is on the brink of financial collapse, an accident lands him in the court of CG (Chitragupt played by Ajay Devgn) that comes replete with apsaras, Devdoot and paap ka ghada. A game is on to decide the fate, and our hero is found guilty of being a liar, greedy, lusty and short tempered. Would he find any redeeming qualities through this game that CG insists was played and copied by a superstar, who started his own show once back on earth after a brush with death. Singham Ajay Devgn looks dashing as modern CG. Kind hearted, he is super helpful like leaving a body in a hospital where one needs kidney transplants. Sidharth Malhotra fits the mantle of this flawed hero. Rakul Preet Singh plays the Miss Goody Two Shoes being on point as a cop, wife, mum and a daughter-in-law. Seema Pahwa, Kiku Sharda and child actor Kiara Khanna do their part well. Some of the scenes and dialogues evoke laughter like the car scene wherein the aggrieved man insists that Ayaan be sent to Kalapani not jail or as devdoot wonders 'Yeh guess kar raha hai ya brag kar raha hai' as Ayaan lists off names of his girlfriends. The film that opens on a comic note isn't a standard Indra Kumar laugh riot but a typical family entertainer. A hefty dose of emotions and continuous tiptoeing between right and wrong, the comic turns super sentimental post the interval. Production quality is great, Mumbai with its Bandrandash;Worli Sea Link in the backdrop paints a pretty picture of the tinsel town and CGI is impressive. What doesn't work is the film feels stretched and dated. May be two old hits ndash; Manike, Hindi version of Sri Lankan Sinhala-language song, recomposed by Tanishk Bagchi and rewritten by Rashmi Virag and Dil De Diya Hai from Indra Kumar's Masti (2004) are the culprit here. If you like typical Bollywood fare that extols values of family and walking the right path, this maybe for you.\ntribuneindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/thank-god-for-small-mercies/","tags":[],"title":"Thank God for small mercies"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Apple seeds first developer beta of macOS Ventura 13.1 Fresh from ending the betas of the milestone release, Apple is now working on the first post-release update for macOS Ventura, with developers getting the first beta build of macOS Ventura 13.1.macOS Ventura 13.1 beta 1 now available for developersNew betas can be acquired from the Apple Developer Center by developers signed up for Apple's test program, or via an over-the-air update for hardware already running beta software.

He used his money to help the LA Police during the 1992 riots. The legend of Shaquille O’Neal grows by the day. Even when he’s spent thousands of hours sharing his story, the world possibly knows only half of everything that transpired in his life. But amongst his stories, there are common themes of generosity and kindness. Shaq believed in giving back to the community. So, when he began to make the big bucks, O’Neal started his charity work. He showed that same spirit during the LA riots of 1992. While the city was burning, O’Neal was concerned for the safety of the cops in the midst of destruction. To help them out, he teamed up with Ford and the LA Police Department. He believed the best way to help them out would be to get them a few more cars. So, Shaquille O’Neal decided to sponsor one, while Ford and the LAPD also sponsored one each. Also read: Is Zion Williamson Playing Tonight Vs Mavericks? Pelicans Issue Injury Report for Their Star Ahead of Matchup Against Luka Doncic Shaquille O’Neal wrote about teaming up with Ford in his book O’Neal was brought up in a military family. His stepfather, who was the only governing father figure in his childhood, had instilled in Shaq the need to respect authority and give back to the community. Always a supporter of the police force, Shaq found the perfect opportunity to execute both his father’s constant teachings. In his book ‘Shaq Uncut,’ Shaquille O’Neal detailed: “When the LA riots broke out in 1992, I called up Lester and told him, “We’ve got to buy those cops some new cars.” He said, “Shaq, they have a budget for that.” I didn’t care. I love law enforcement, and I love cops. I was already starting to go through the Police Academy, so I figured it couldn’t hurt from a public relations standpoint. I had a deal with Ford, so I said, “Hey, here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to have these cars and you can stand up on the stage with me when we give them out.” Ford paid for one, I paid for one, and the LA Police Department paid for one. It was good for me, good for Ford, and good for the LA cops. A win-win-win, I think they call that.” Diesel has served multiple roles in law enforcement At the time of writing the book, Shaq was still not involved with the police station. He was still hopeful of becoming a cop. And we all know, Shaq is not a wind that can easily be stopped. He has sufficiently fulfilled his dream of being a cop. The 7’1″ Lakers legend is an honorary Deputy Marshal. He is also in the reserve police forces for Florida, Arizona, and California. Recently, Shaq also became a part of the Sheriff’s office in Henry County. He works as the director of community relations.

Fernando Alonso found himself in a controversy following the 2022 US GP. The Spaniard lost his hard-earned points following a protest by Haas for a missing side mirror. Haas objected on the basis that Alonso competed with a damaged car While Haas was forced to pit Kevin Magnussen in order to repair the damage that called for a black and orange flag. Team Principal Guenther Steiner pushed firmly for the protest which resulted in Alonso getting a 30-second post-race penalty. But Steiner says they weren’t targeting Alonso or Alpine. Rather, the FIA must be uniform with its ruling. BREAKING: Fernando Alonso has received a 30-second penalty as his car was sent back on track in an unsafe condition He drops down to P15, with Vettel (P7), Magnussen (P8), Tsunoda (P9) and Ocon (P10) all moving up in the points#USGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/zW9cC89Nwj — Formula 1 (@F1) October 24, 2022 Also Read: “It’s going to be really tough for Ferrari or Mercedes” – Nico Rosberg says 8-time Constructor’s champions no match for Red Bull in 2023 Guenther Steiner on Fernando Alonso’s penalty The validity of Sergio Perez’s car was also protested by Haas along with Fernando Alonso’s car. Steiner said loose parts like Perez’s front wing or Alonso’s mirror posed a safety risk to drivers. He adds, “If there is a mirror missing and the rule says you need to have two mirrors, why can you say, ‘we had an incident; there’s only one?’ You still need to have two.” Alonso and Stroll come together #USGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/H8Wbs0GaXL — Formula 1 (@F1) October 23, 2022 Debris from Alonso’s car following his crash was seen raining down on the Haas of Mick Schumacher. In the end, it was just Alonso that received a penalty. But Steiner doesn’t have much to sympathise with the 2-time World Champion. Steiner adds, “I mean, there was one mirror. How we lost it, I don’t really care. We saw it flapping, and then they should get a black and orange, and then it flew off. And then he should be disqualified because he has no safety equipment.” Also Read: “Guenther Steiner should look at himself”: Mick Schumacher’s uncle criticizes Haas team bosses for being unfair on drivers Why Fernando Alonso received a 30-second post-race time penalty? Fernando Alonso suffered a horrific collision on lap 21. The Spaniard was trailing the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll and was closing in on an overtake. But Stroll swerved in at the last moment and the two drivers came in contact. Alonso’s car was launched up and sent straight to the barriers. However, the Spaniard managed to keep the car running and even managed to secure points after finishing P7. But his A522 had some damage which included a missing right side-view mirror. Interesting words from @alo_oficial . #F1. pic.twitter.com/FyY0rbV43D — Jennie Gow (@JennieGow) October 24, 2022 This made Haas question the safety of the car. And Haas lodged a complaint against both Alonso’s car and Red Bull’s Sergio Perez who suffered front wing damage during the initial laps of the race. Perez’s car was deemed to be safe. But Alonso received a 30-second post-race penalty after the car was considered unsafe. This dropped him out of points from P7 to P15. The side mirrors are part of the safety requirement. Thus violating Article 3.2 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations that “a car must be in a safe condition throughout a race.” As a result of this point, the team has protested the admissibility of the original Haas F1 Team protest. [5/5] — BWT Alpine F1 Team (@AlpineF1Team) October 24, 2022 Alpine has challenged the permissibility of Haas’s protest. According to the protest was lodged 24 minutes past the deadline and hence invalid. The case shall be settled on Thursday ahead of the 2022 Mexico City GP via video conference. If Alpine are to challenge the verdict, there will be a separate hearing that will take place at a later date.

Although this may not sound like much, the company says it equates to 200 minutes a month - or 40 hours a year - based on the five meetings a week over a third (34%) of workers say they have. What’s more, most 18-24 year olds (78%) took up to 10 minutes, as opposed to only 57% of 55-64 year olds.

The Memphis Grizzlies welcomed the Brooklyn Nets to the FedEx Forum last night. Ja Morant, Desmond Bane, and co. kept the Nets’ ‘All-Star duo of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving at bay, en route to a magnificent victory. The Nets pair however, were phenomenal in their losing battle. Both men put up 35+ points (37 each) on an efficient night, yet they wound up being defeated. Perhaps the duo needs their teammates to provide some assistance, rather than burden the majority of the weight on their shoulders. There was a humorous moment, while the players were in the midst of their warmup prior to the match kicking off when a Grizzlies supporter attempted to recruit Durant to Memphis. “Come to Memphis, KD!” This Grizzlies fan was tryna recruit Durant (via sheri_hensley.pcb/IG) pic.twitter.com/CtR0Qg98V3 — Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) October 25, 2022 The fan yelled- “Come to Memphis KD. Come to Memphis. Come on baby. We want you.” Funnily enough, the Grizz were actually in the mix when it came to the KD sweepstakes this past offseason. they weren’t a frontrunner but reports had stated they were at the very least interested. Kevin Durant, following their appeals, just looked back at them and smiled. An amusing interaction to say the least.

The fixture between the Nets and Grizzlies was nothing short of action-packed and electrifying. In sublime fashion, the young energetic Grizzlies walked away with a compelling victory, defending their home turf over veterans of the game. Ja Morant went on to score a tremendous 38 points, whilst accumulating seven assists and eight rebounds. A near triple-double, which is now displaying a pattern every time the Grizzlies protagonist graces the floor. View this post on Instagram A post shared by NBA on ESPN (@nbaonespn) Desmond Bane, on the other hand, went on to have a career night, racking up 38 points, whilst hitting the mark from three-point range, effortlessly. Bane shot 8/11 from beyond the arc, whilst accumulating seven assists, proving that he can spread the ball at an elite level all while being a distributor in the half court. All in all, a good night for the Memphis roster, who seem to have stepped up a notch in their pursuit for NBA gold.

The franchise and the two-time NBA champion have now reconciled with either side shifting their focus onto an NBA title. In a meeting with Nets owner Joe Tsai, Kevin Durant reiterated his trade request and informed Tsai that Tsai needs to choose between Durant or the pairing of general manager Sean Marks and coach Steve Nash, sources say. Story: https://t.co/W1voNf9MDC — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) August 8, 2022 However, with the surge in talent in the NBA, the depths and hurdles through which a franchise will have to go through to clinch the title, will be nothing short of grueling and onerous.

Together, I look forward to enhancing our cooperation on issues critical to global security and prosperity, including continuing our strong support for Ukraine,\" U.S. President Joe Biden tweeted on Tuesday.Earlier during a Diwali celebration at the White House on Monday, referring to Sunak becoming the British Prime Minister, Biden had said, \"It’s pretty astounding, a groundbreaking milestone and it matters.\" The Kremlin on Tuesday said that Russia sees no reason to expect relations with the U.K. to improve under Sunak.Russia does not see any \"preconditions, grounds, or hope” for building more constructive relations with Great Britain in the foreseeable future, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, commenting on the appointment of Sunak as the U.K.’s new prime minister.\"No, at present, we do not see any preconditions, grounds or hopes for some positive shifts in the foreseeable future,\" the Russian presidential spokesman was quoted as saying by the official TASS news agency.Peskov said this while commenting on the prospects of warmer relations between the two countries with the appointment of the U.K.’s new prime minister.Russia-U.K. relations have soured even further since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. The U.K. responded with several rounds of sanctions, and it is one of the main backers of President Volodymyr Zelensky. The U.K. has also provided substantial military support to Ukraine, the report added.Congratulating Sunak, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a tweet said the partnership between Canada and the U.K. \"is defined by the history – and the priorities – we share.\"\"As we work to deliver results for the people who call Canada and the United Kingdom home, let’s continue to strengthen this partnership,\" he said.Ukraine's President Zelenskyy tweeted his congratulations to Sunak. \"I wish you to successfully overcome all the challenges facing British society and the whole world today. I'm ready to continue strengthening the Ukraine-UK strategic partnership together!\" he said.French President Emmanuel Macron also congratulated Sunak.\"Together we will continue working to tackle the challenges of the moment, including the war in Ukraine and its many consequences for Europe and the world,\" Macron tweeted.China's leadership has said that it wants to \"advance ties with the U.K.\" under Sunak, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin was quoted as saying by the BBC.\"We hope that we can work with the U.K. side on the basis of mutual respect and win-win co-operation and advance China-U.K. relations along the right track,\" he said.Sunak has favoured closer ties with China than his predecessor and was criticised by Truss for pursuing a trading relationship when chancellor, the report added.Australia’s treasurer, Jim Chalmers, called Sunak a great friend of Australia and lauded the significance of Britain having its first prime minister of Asian descent, The Canberra Times newspaper reported.\"I don’t think it’s insignificant that a country like the United Kingdom has its first prime minister of colour,\" he said on Tuesday.European leaders couched their well-wishes with statements on the need for a stable and predictable neighbour.The European Council president, Charles Michel, tweeted his congratulations on Monday night, emphasising that Brussels and London faced shared challenges.\"Working together is the only way to face common challenges... and bringing stability is key to overcoming them,\" he wrote.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has congratulated Sunak on becoming prime minister.But she added that the EU-U.K. relationship must be in \"full respect of our agreements\" - likely in part a reference to the ongoing dispute on the Northern Ireland Protocol.The European Commission and U.K. government restarted talks on how to fix the post Brexit treaty this autumn, during Truss’s brief premiership.The president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, said the EU legislature was committed to having \"a strong and constructive relationship with the U.K.\"New Zealand's Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson says the new British leader is a \"good friend\" of his country, the NZ Herald reported.He hoped the Tory leader would help seal a free trade agreement with his country.\"Clearly, the U.K. is facing some very significant economic issues at the moment, he’s said that himself. Inflation up over 10%, the energy crisis, the war in Ukraine, so it’s going to be a very tough time for him,\" he said.\"So, we wish Rishi Sunak well.

Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports LOS ANGELES—Lakers’ forward LeBron James is on track to surpass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer this season and when he does it is unlikely to sit well with the Hall of Fame center, Magic Johnson said. James needs 1,244 points to eclipse Abdul-Jabbar, who has held the record since April 1984. “I don’t think well,” Johnson said when asked in a podcast how he thinks Abdul-Jabbar will handle losing the title he has held for nearly four decades. “Let’s be honest. And the fact that it’s a dude playing for the Lakers too. It’s a dude playing in LA. I think it will be a hard pill to swallow.” Abdul-Jabbar, a six-time champion and six-time MVP whose signature “skyhook” shot was nearly unstoppable, is sometimes unfairly overlooked in conversations over the greatest ever to play the game but his advocates have always been able to point to the scoring title. Johnson said Abdul-Jabbar probably never believed anyone would surpass his total of 38,387 regular season points. “I think he thought he was going to have it forever,” Johnson said. FILE–Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. (Photo by Joseph Prezioso / AFP) James raised eyebrows earlier this month when he was asked about his thoughts on potentially passing Abdul-Jabbar and his relationship with him and offered a short and frosty reply. “No thoughts and no relationship,” James said. Abdul-Jabbar, who like James is a vocal advocate for social justice causes, criticized James when he said that getting the COVID-19 vaccine was a personal choice. He has also called some of James’ on-court celebrations “stupid and childish.” Johnson said he wishes the pair had a better relationship and believes they will come together down the road. “I think that one day that’s going to happen, and if I can play a part in that, I would love to,” Johnson said. “But let him pass him first. Let that soak in for a minute, and then put the two men together because they are going to find out they are similar.” RELATED STORIES Read Next Don’t miss out on the latest news and information.

In Italy, the conclusion of an investigation usually precedes any request from prosecutors to send suspects to trial. Juventus, its board, leading executives and members of the board of its statutory auditors have been informed that the current phase of the investigation has ended, Anna Maria Loreto, chief prosecutor in the club's home city of Turin, said in a statement late on Monday. A source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters that there are 15 suspects in all, in addition to the club itself, including club president Andrea Agnelli. Juventus, a business listed on the Milan Stock Exchange and Italy's most successful football club, said it believed it had followed the correct procedures. \"Juventus remains convinced... to have acted in compliance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial reports, in accordance with accounting principles and in line with the international practice in the football industry,\" the club said in a statement. The Turin prosecutor alleged that Juventus understated its financial losses for 2018, 2019 and 2020. Prosecutors have been looking into the values ascribed to player transfers between clubs and whether, as stated, salaries were sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic or simply deferred. Juventus, one of 12 leading European clubs that made a failed attempt to set up a breakaway European Super League in April 2021 to beef up its finances, is controlled by Exor, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family. Last month, the Serie A side said it would finish the current financial year in the red after it reported a record 254 million euros ($253.29 million) annual loss during the previous year. In 2021, the club completed a 400 million euro capital hike to shore up its finances, in its second rights issue in the span of three years.

Yesterday’s Summit brought a bunch of news for Android app development. This includes several updates to Jetpack Compose, the stable release of Baseline Profile generation, and a detailed look at what Google wants Android apps to look like on foldables and tablets. Jetpack Compose gains Material You, Android TV apps, and more What Android tablet \u0026 foldable apps would like in Google’s perfect world [Gallery] Spotted by our Dylan Roussel, the new Android Studio logo is a pretty big revamp compared to the older one. The old design had a drawing compass in front of a blueprint with the Android logo poking its head over top, while the new version ditches the blueprint and has the compass look more like an “A.” It’s a simpler, more visually distinctive look. Notably, this new look won’t be showing up for all developers just yet. For the time being, this change is attached to Android Studio Flamingo, the latest Canary version of the tool that Google just released yesterday . The current stable version of Android Studio sticks with the original design. It will probably be a few months before this new logo fully replaces the original, meaning we probably won’t see it as the Android Studio logo until sometime in 2023.

One of those was Guided Frame, a special mode that allows more users to take top-notch selfies. Here’s how Guided Frame on the Pixel 7 works. Guided Frame is a pretty simple concept. Using the Pixel 7’s front-facing camera along with Google’s TalkBack mode, your phone can help take selfies even if you can’t necessarily see the process clearly. With TalkBack, a selfie has a few extra implementations. First off, your phone will vibrate at different times to help you identify when the camera is actually framing your face properly. Along with that, your pixel will audibly guide you, letting you know where to move your head for the best shot. Who is Guided Frame for? TalkBack is a huge feature and does take a bit of time to learn. That’s why both it and Guided Frame were intentionally designed for the visually impaired community, making it much easier to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be difficult. Related: ‘TalkBack’ on your Pixel: What it is and how to turn it on or off Those who use TalkBack on a regular basis will have an easy time taking selfies to share with others. Guided Frame works very well and the results are genuinely good. On top of that, the Pixel 7 series was the first to make use of this new feature, however, Google noted that the Pixel 6 lineup will also see Guided Frame at some point in the future via software update. This is because the Pixel 6’s Tensor Chip has the same basic framework as the Tensor G2, allowing the phone to make use of the AI-based feature. How to turn on Guided Frame As mentioned, Guided Frame is a part of TalkBack on your Pixel, meaning you need to enable that feature to get your phone to verbally guide your selfies. We have an in-depth guide on TalkBack for the Pixel, though we’ll leave the highlights in the steps below: On your Pixel, head to your settings . From there, scroll down and find Accessibility . Tap TalkBack . To turn it on, tap Use TalkBack . To turn on the quick shortcut, tap TalkBack shortcut . From there, simply hold your volume buttons down for a couple of seconds. TalkBack should turn on and limit your phone’s touch capabilities. If you double-tap your power button you should open the camera app – so long as that shortcut is enabled. Once the camera is open, you can select the camera switch button and get guided photos. Your Pixel will audibly give you instructions for framing your face. On top of that, your phone will vibrate to let you know went the shot looks good. Once you’re ready, a three-second countdown will begin. Guided Frame will be active so long as the camera app is open and the selfie camera is active. The Pixel 7′ s Guided Frame feature is a fantastic tool that really simplifies taking selfies for those who are visually impaired. The feature is easy to turn on and use so long as you’re used to using TalkBack. For those who don’t need the feature, it’s generally not something we recommend turning on.

Understand How UST And LUNA Lost All Value Let’s try and understand why this popular coin lost all of its value in just a few days\nLUNA is the native cryptocurrency of the Terra ecosystem. Before the Terra Luna crypto crash happened, the cryptocurrency was among the top 10 largest crypto coins in the world by its total market capitalisation and also one of the most popular. However, since the crash, Terra Luna has lost over 99.9% of its value. Why did a once popular and trusted crypto project crash and burn to an extent where almost all of its value was wiped out? Let’s try and understand.What Is Terra Luna And UST?Terra is a blockchain platform that caters to the creation of stablecoins. This blockchain network was created in 2018 by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin of Terraform Labs. The Terra blockchain platform also provides the capability of smart contracts and DApps. As mentioned above, LUNA is the native cryptocurrency token of the Terra platform and is used for carrying out transactions and paying gas fees. Moreover, LUNA holders can also partake in the platform’s governance system by voting on proposals related to changes in the Terra ecosystem. Finally, since the Terra blockchain functions on a proof-of-stake basis, LUNA is staked in the ecosystem for consensus and validation of network transactions. UST is a stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Stablecoins are those cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to another commodity, currency or financial instrument. However, UST is an algorithmic stablecoin, meaning its value is not backed by any real assets. The value of UST is backed by Luna instead and it uses a unique algorithm to always maintain the value of 1 UST = $1. If the price of UST goes up above $1, the algorithm mines more LUNA tokens in order to stabilise the value of UST at $1 and vice versa.So Why Did LUNA Crash?Before the LUNA crash, about $2 billion worth of UST was unstaked from the Anchor Protocol and hundreds of millions of it were then immediately sold. It is still unknown exactly why someone carried out this action but some suspect that it was a form of a malicious attack on the Terra ecosystem. This large sell-off pushed the price of UST down to $0.91 cents. So people started to purchase LUNA with UST in droves because even if the price of UST is lower than $1, 1 UST can always be redeemed against 1$ worth of LUNA. However, at the same time, the overall crypto market was experiencing a major crash, which lead to the price of LUNA crashing. At this point, the market capitalisation of LUNA fell below UST. This was a problem because the UST was algorithmically linked to LUNA for stabilisation. As a result, the UST got de-pegged since the total value of UST could not be redeemed against LUNA. As the UST got de-pegged, everyone who held this stablecoin started selling it off since they lost confidence in the coin. This also directly caused the value of LUNA to crash at a very fast rate. All of this happened in such a short duration of time that the algorithm which maintained the value of UST at $1 failed to maintain the stablecoin’s price. Since the prices of both UST and Luna started crashing hard at the same time, investors sold off all their holdings on the open market. The significantly increased supply of LUNA on crypto markets along with the de-pegging of UST ultimately made investors lose confidence in the project and so the price of LUNA continued to crash till it was basically worthless. As a result, LUNA and UST were delisted from most major crypto exchanges around the world. While the co-founder Do Kwon came up with a plan to revive the cryptocurrency, crypto experts are skeptical about the chances of LUNA recovering to its original price..

That won’t stop anytime soon, but I feel like this deal on the Pixel 6a may not be eclipsed even by the wildness of Q4 price cuts. With an MSRP of $449, a drop of $150 is a pretty big deal for any piece of tech, and in this particular case, the Pixel 6a isn’t just some random phone. While it surely isn’t a perfect phone, it does hit a lot of high notes for a mid-ranger. With the same Tensor SoC as the Pixel 6, a stellar camera experience and the look/feel of the Pixel 6 line of phones, the Pixel 6a is a solid purchase at its full $449 MSRP. However, we know price cuts are part of the mid-range smartphone game, and the Pixel 6a has already had a few discounts along the way. We’ve seen it hit this exact $299 price point, actually, but it required purchase through a carrier and activation. This time around, that’s not the case. For an unknown amount of time, the Pixel 6a can be yours outright for $299 from a few places. Target, Amazon and the Google Store are all participating in the offer, so you are free to order online or hop over to your local Target store and simply pick one up. All three stores are carrying all three colors, but it looks like Target might be sold out of the Sage color at the moment. Shop Pixel 6a on Chrome Shop Other discounts on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro It is also worth noting that you can get the Pixel 6 for $499 or the Pixel 6 Pro for $649 via carrier deals at the moment as well. While these are definitely not the lowest prices we’ve seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, it is worth taking a look at these devices if you’d like a bit more RAM, storage or higher refresh screen options. I’d say the Pixel 6 is likely worth the $200 upgrade over the Pixel 6a at these prices, but if your budget says otherwise, the Pixel 6a is still a solid phone. While we’ve seen better deals on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro in the past, they required carrier activation. These current deals from Best Buy, Target and Amazon don’t carry any such requirements, so they should be in the conversation if you are looking at the Pixel 6a. In a recent conversation with a co-worker, it became clear to me pretty quickly that for most users, the benefits to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are minimal when compared to the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Sure, there are upgrades, but the price gap between the two is pretty monumental with sales like these, so it’s worth considering the Pixel 6a, Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro right now for many of you. But act quickly: these things tend to disappear before you know it.

All-rounder Marcus Stoinis has provided a shot in the arm to Australia’s ICC T20 World Cup 2022 campaign via a match-winning half-century against Sri Lanka in the seventh Super 12 match at the Optus Stadium tonight. Chasing a 158-run target, defending champions Australia had failed to gain any advantage in the powerplay on the back of scoring 33/1 under fielding restrictions. While the run-chase was first given some acceleration by all-rounder Glenn Maxwell (23), it was Stoinis’ power-packed knock which propelled them to not just a victory but a significant improvement in their NRR (Net Run Rate) as well. Stoinis, who scored 59* (18) with the help of four fours and six sixes at a strike rate of 327.77, registered a second T20I half-century to win a maiden Player of the Match award in his 49th match. Shoaib Akhtar compliments Marcus Stoinis for scoring fastest 50 in T20 international among Australian batters Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar took to social media platform Twitter to express approval of Stoinis’ innings. Returning from an injury in the tournament, Stoinis winning a match on his own is an ideal-case scenario for this Australian middle-order. Wow, @MStoinis you beauty! What an inning. — Shoaib Akhtar (@shoaib100mph) October 25, 2022 Coming in to bat at No. 5 in the 13th over, Stoinis dominated in a 25-ball 69-run fourth-wicket partnership finishing the match with 21 deliveries to go. The same was possible on the back of a brutal display of batting in Perth. Having hit a boundary on the third delivery that he faced, Stoinis hit two more fours in the following Dasun Shanaka over. Taking on the attack against the Sri Lankan spinners, the right-handed batter smashed a four and as many as five sixes in the next two Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana overs. Having scored the second-fastest half-century (17 balls) in a T20 World Cup, the 33-year old player also managed to register the fastest T20I half-century among Australian batters.

Stephen Curry demolished any doubts surrounding his legacy last season. His playoff performance was nothing short of magic. The shooting wizard took down some fearsome opponents and won his fourth championship. His brilliance also helped him bag his first-ever Finals MVP. Through his campaign, Curry has found a surprising supporter in Kevin Garnett. The Boston Celtics legend is convinced of Steph’s greatness. He is mesmerized by his game, by his spirit. And he believes that the Baby-Faced Assassin is solely responsible for usurping LeBron James’ era. Also read: “LeBron James, Same Sh*t Like Adam Levine”: Sofia Franklyn Reveals How Lakers Star Uses NDAs to Cheat on Savannah James Stephen Curry is the flag bearer of the three-point era In an episode of KG Certified, Garnett discussed the current era of basketball and made an astute observation. The Hall of Famer claimed that LeBron James’ era was over. His statement essentially means that LeBron isn’t the best player in the league anymore. Not MVP or even Finals MVP. Those two awards shouldn’t be seen as the markers of the best player in the league. And Kevin Garnett definitely understands that demarcation. Instead, KG claimed that it was now the era of Stephen Curry. He took note of how the Warriors superstar had changed the game. Garnett praised Stephen Curry for his long-range shooting. The way he has changed the game and made the defense acknowledge the threat of long-range shooting. Effectively, Curry stretched the three-point line way too close to the half-court line. Steph took over a league that was once ruled by athletic big men. So, KG believes that we must give the 6’2″ PG more respect. And he also wants us to understand that with LeBron James’ era ending, there is no doubt about Steph’s legacy. View this post on Instagram A post shared by KG: Certified (@kgcertified) Will Curry win more titles than LeBron James? Steph is on a mission. A mission that started last season. With a scoring title behind him, Curry started the 2021-22 season on an 18-2 win streak. The momentum spilled right into the playoffs. Curry carried the Dubs on his shoulders to their 4th rin in 8 years. This season seems similar. He has already registered three games with 30+ points and he has made at least 4 threes every game. James Wiseman’s addition to the lineup has also given GSW an added big man. Stephen Curry definitely can realistically win his 5th ring this year. If he does, he will have won more championships than LeBron James and Shaquille O’Neal. That would change how the world perceives him. Also read: Is Klay Thompson Playing Tonight vs Suns?

While Nothing's store won't be big, it's also sitting in one of the posher parts of London. Where the average retail rent in the city is about £64 per square foot, Soho's is estimated at just under £150. That's a lot to spend when it's unclear how customers will respond.This strategy is familiar, mind you. Apple has long focused on opening stores in high-traffic (and sometimes iconic) locations to catch the eyes of shoppers who wouldn't otherwise browse technology, and other companies have used similar approaches. Nothing Stores could theoretically make the brand more recognizable, not to mention reinforce its style-oriented image.\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/a-store-that-sells-nothing-will-open-in-london-this-year/","tags":["Shopping","site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Jon Fingas"],"title":"A store that sells Nothing will open in London this year"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Amit Shah meets BJP leaders from Saurashtra ahead of Gujarat polls Union Home Minister and senior BJP leader Amit Shah on Tuesday met party leaders from the Saurashtra region of Gujarat to formulate strategy for the coming Assembly elections in the state.

The meeting centred on the Bharatiya Janata Party's efforts to avoid its poor performance of 2017 in the region which accounts for 48 out of 182 seats in the Assembly, they said. Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and Gujarat BJP president C R Paatil were also present at the meeting. Present and past elected representatives as well as office- bearers and senior leaders from the region attended the meeting which was held at a marketing yard building in Veraval town.

It’s the validation of a longstanding rumor that the UK’s public broadcaster was looking to move the show from its traditional distribution network.Back in July, Bloomberg reported that Disney was looking for “established” brands to bolster its streaming platform. The world’s longest-running science-fantasy series, with its own global fanbase, certainly counts as a big draw for any global streamer.Naturally, new series of Doctor Who will continue to air on the BBC’s own channels and streaming platform, iPlayer, in the UK and Ireland. The series will return in November 2023 with a run of specials to celebrate the show’s 60th anniversary, followed by a new series in 2024.At the same time, the BBC has announced a new logo and branding that will feature on the show when it returns in 2023, as well as its vast catalog of merchandise. The new logo is a 21st century update of the classic “diamond” logo, designed by Bernard Lodge in 1973.It's one of the most recognizable images in the show's long history, and while the diamond's shelf-life in the series proper stretched from 1973 to 1980 (for all but one year of Tom Baker's Tenure) — it was also plastered on merchandise from the early '70s all the way through to 1996. (Ironically, it was supplanted by a revamped version of the show's 1969-1974 logo.)Back in 2018, the BBC recruited branding agency LittleHawk to revitalize the show’s image with a look covering both its Classic and New Series eras. The fact that, so quickly afterward, the show has opted to switch back to an older look stands as a repudiation of LittleHawk’s work. Not to mention the fact it’ll cause much consternation to the buyers of the show’s flagship Collection Blu-Ray boxsets. Who will, once again, have to deal with an inconsistent run of spines running along their shelves and are, arguably, the real victims in all of this.\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/future-doctor-who-seasons-will-air-on-disney/","tags":["site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Daniel Cooper"],"title":"Future ‘Doctor Who’ seasons will air on Disney+"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Coimbatore district reports eight new COVID-19 cases thehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/coimbatore-district-reports-eight-new-covid-19-cases/","tags":[],"title":"Coimbatore district reports eight new COVID-19 cases"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Tech giant Apple urges global supply chain to decarbonise by 2030 Apple exhorted its global supply chain to decarbonise by 2030, as the tech giant said it will evaluate the work of its major manufacturing partners to decarbonise their Apple-related operations\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/tech-giant-apple-urges-global-supply-chain-to-decarbonise-by-2030/","tags":[],"title":"Tech giant Apple urges global supply chain to decarbonise by 2030"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Champions League: Vital to book last 16 place before final game, says Tottenham’s Conte Victory against Sporting Lisbon will guarantee a place in the last 16 for Tottenham.\nsportstar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/champions-league-vital-to-book-last-16-place-before-final-game-says-totte/","tags":[],"title":"Champions League: Vital to book last 16 place before final game, says Tottenham’s Conte"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Texas Natural Gas Prices Go Negative Yesterday, Waha natural gas sank to near zero levels.

The company’s new foldable phone is set to release in select European markets almost three months after its China debut. According to GSMArena, the 8GB RAM and 256GB storage option of the foldable phone, which is still only available in Satin Black, will retail for 1,200 euros, which is roughly Rs 98,500. Although Motorola has not yet made the availability date public, those keen can anticipate hearing about it soon enough. The company also did not say anything about the India release of the new Moto Razr 2022. If launched in India, the Moto Razr 2022 would take on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4, which folds the same way as the Razr 2022. The Galaxy Z Flip 4 starts at Rs 89,999 in India. The Razr 2022 features a 6.7-inch FHD+ OLED foldable screen with a 144Hz refresh rate. The chin from the earlier Razr versions has been eliminated, and the hinge mechanism has been reworked. Additionally, the phone comes with a 2.7-inch OLED cover screen that users can use to access most of the functionality without having to unfold the main screen, the report added. You get Android 12-based MyUX on the Razr 2022, and the company has not said anything about future software updates. The Motorola Moto Razr 2022 features a 50-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 13-megapixel ultrawide module. On the main display, there is a 32-megapixel camera housed inside the punch-hole on the top. The new Moto Razr 2022 comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, as we mentioned. However, the 8GB/128GB and 12GB/512GB variants don’t seem to be included in the initial global release, according to the report. There is no support for a microSD card on the phone. The Motorola Moto Razr 2022 includes a 3,500mAh battery with 30W charging, eSIM + physical SIM slot, IP52 splash rating, and dual speakers with Dolby Atmos. — Edited excerpts from IANS The post Motorola Moto Razr 2022 flip phone arrives in Europe, India launch likely appeared first on BGR India.\nbgr\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/motorola-moto-razr-2022-flip-phone-arrives-in-europe-india-launch-likely/","tags":["Mobiles","News","moto razr 2022 launch","Moto Razr 2022 price","Motorola Moto Razr 2022"],"title":"Motorola Moto Razr 2022 flip phone arrives in Europe, India launch likely"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Coca-Cola beats profit estimates in Q3, raises full-year guidance The company said it now sees organic revenue growth of 14% to 15% for the full year.

In an article published in the scientific journal PNAS, Umeå researcher Fredrik Almqvist and his colleagues present a new type of antibiotic that effectively kills hard-to-fight bacteria.

Professor, Department of Chemistry, Umeå University Fredrik Almqvist is a professor at the Department of Chemistry at Umeå University and has been researching new alternatives to antibiotics since the late 1990s. Effective antibiotics are crucial for saving lives in areas such as surgery, cancer treatment and intensive care, but also for treating common diseases such as chlamydia or pneumonia. But as antibiotic resistance increases, the clock is ticking for the scientific community. \"Antibiotic resistance is listed by the WHO as one of the planet's greatest challenges.

Studies conducted at Umeå University and Washington University in St. Louis could be an important piece of the puzzle in the fight against dangerous bacteria. The new class of antibiotics, which the researchers call GmPcides, fights so-called Gram-positive bacteria. According to the studies, they are effective on their own, but also enhance their effectiveness when combined with existing antibiotics. \"This is the fruit of a long collaboration between chemists and molecular biologists in Umeå and the team in St. Louis led by Professor Scott Hultgren. It's a privilege to work with so many fantastic researchers,\" says Fredrik Almqvist. The research shows that the GmPcides cannot only stop bacteria from dividing, but also kill bacteria that are not growing. Something that other antibiotics often struggle to do. Fredrik Almqvist is very hopeful about the results published in the prestigious journal PNAS. \"This is a first step, a new class that has exciting properties, and now of course we are working to develop these into something that can also help people in the future. Our goal is to come up with a substance to which bacteria do not easily become resistant.\" Umeå University Nye, T.M., et al.

In cloud computing, in contrast, the computations happen in centralized data storage and processing units in which algorithms enjoy the luxury of complex computations. Edge computing decentralizes such computations for reasons of privacy, latency, or energy efficiency. For his Ph.D. thesis, Emad Ibrahim used methods and practices from digital signal processing and machine learning to generate new solutions hosted on edge platforms. Applications hosted on an edge platform require resource-aware strategies to fit a certain algorithm in the limited storage and processing budget of the edge devices. In his Ph.D. research, Emad Ibrahim used methods, practices, and processes of both digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML), with the intention of generating new solutions at the system level where DSP techniques improve the ability of ML models to converge on an optimized solution. Ultrasonic gestures Any edge device requires also a means of control. Acoustics from commercially off-the-shelf (COTS) sensor components can be used as a means for contactless control via in-air ultrasonic gestures and/or speech. The core brain for such control is a systematic combination of DSP and ML techniques. In-air ultrasonic gestures are hand gestures that are detected by first transmitting an ultrasound signal from a device and then extracting useful information from the received echoes. This can be of great value in devices that lack enough space to host physical buttons. The combination of low-cost speech recognition with ultrasonic gesture recognition opens the door for innovative applications in consumer electronics. Ultrasonic definitions use the Doppler shift due to hand (object) motion as a building block, where its variations in time and space construct unique detectable patterns. Some edge devices have space to accommodate only one sensor, while others have more space to host multiple sensors. Each of these scenarios can have a different computation flow that requires further research for optimum performance where Ibrahim and his colleagues explore and recommend different applications. One such application presented in Ibrahim's work is a Virtual Proximity Detector (VPD) that can be used to robustly detect proximity in smartphones using solely the ultrasound band in the built-in speaker. Another application is detecting hand gestures using a small-form factor sensor array that is small enough to be embedded in consumer electronics such as smart speakers.

In addition, the lack of prognostic markers is a significant impediment to personalized treatment.\nMalignant tumors in the head and neck region are very heterogeneous and therefore difficult to treat. In addition, the lack of prognostic markers is a significant impediment to personalized treatment. A joint study by MedUni Vienna and the Christian Doppler Laboratory for Applied Metabolomics focused on the development and identification of specific markers to improve risk assessment for patients. The study was published in the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging. So far, only limited research has been done on the genetic characteristics of the extremely diverse tumors in the head and neck region. There are also no suitable parameters for risk assessment in high-risk patients. This is the context for the recent study conducted by the research team led by Lukas Kenner from MedUni Vienna's Clinical Institute of Pathology and Alexander Haug from MedUni Vienna's Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine in cooperation with the Christian Doppler Laboratory for Metabolomics and its corporate partner Siemens Healtheneers. Based on DNA sequencing of 127 tissue samples from affected patients, the researchers analyzed the cellular characteristics of the tumors using artificial intelligence (AI) and positron emission tomography (PET) as an imaging method. The aim of the retrospective study (lead author Clemens Spielvogel) was to calculate specific numbers that can be used as markers for risk assessment in patients by combining the data from the genetic analysis and imaging. First, the DNA from the tissue sections was sequenced, the three-dimensional PET images of the patients were evaluated, and specific image patterns extracted. The research team then merged the data using machine learning algorithms to identify genetic networks with different patterns of disruption in the tumors that trigger cellular senescence. Cellular senescence means that the cells neither divide nor secrete inflammatory messenger substances, but still do not die. The problem here is that these cells can release molecules into neighboring tissues that contribute to further tumor development. The results of the study show that cellular senescence in combination with the specific patterns that were extracted in the course of the analysis are associated with high risk for head and neck cancer patients. In conclusion, the computationally identified markers from genetic and image-based data are a more effective means of capturing the heterogeneity of the tumors. This makes it possible to develop and apply more targeted treatment options swiftly and to monitor high-risk patients more closely. The term head and neck tumors covers various types of cancer that occur in these parts of the body, including carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and nose and sinuses. Most of the malignant tumors are squamous-cell carcinomas, i.e. tumors that originate from surface cells. Other, less common, tumors are adenocarcinomas, which originate from glandular tissue, and sarcomas from soft tissue. According to estimates from the international database Global Cancer Studies, more than 830,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with head and neck cancer every year. According to Statistics Austria, 1,184 men and 404 women were diagnosed with ENT cancer in Austria in 2019. Smoking and alcohol consumption, but also human papilloma viruses are risk factors for head and neck cancer. Medical University of Vienna Spielvogel, C.P., et al.

Because of the pitch, I got bounce and that is why I enjoyed bowling against these three batsmen. Nets pitches and practice pitches are different because of the bounce the batters were having difficulties. All three of them are World Class players and bowling to them was fun,\" Muhammad Irfan told ANI. \"I am here in Sydney since 2019. I play for the Western suburbs district. Through New South Wales I got an opportunity and I have come to give every team practice before that is why I come to every session for practice,\" he said. 'Chasemaster' Virat Kohli slammed an unbeaten 83 as India pulled off a miracle four-wicket victory over Pakistan in a final over thriller at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup in Melbourne last Sunday. \"Recently Virat helped India win a match against Pakistan. So, it felt great to bowl to him in nets. He is the best batsman in the world. Virat Kohli gave me best wishes and to hear it from one of the best in the world is great,\" he added. During the session, Rahul and Dinesh Karthik faced Ravichandran Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal in the nets. Karthik also practised throw-downs with Kohli. Everything happened under the watchful eyes of Head coach Rahul Dravid and batting coach Vikram Rathour. Rahul and Rohit played some crisp drives and looked in good touch which will reduce management's concerns over the openers' form slump. Rohit who failed to play a critical knock against Pakistan on Sunday had an intense extended practice in the nets. Rishabh Pant was also seen playing some measured shots in the nets.

China is one of India’s large trading partners, with trade flows between the two countries having grown 59% from about $72 billion in 2014-15, to hit $115.4 billion in 2021-22. “Since India-China trade started picking up, the growth in exports to China has been much higher than the import growth,” a Commerce Ministry official told The Hindu . From $11.9 billion in 2014-15, India’s exports to China had risen 78.1% to $21.25 billion last year, while imports stood at $94.16 billion, 55.8% over the $60.4 billion recorded in 2014-15. By contrast, imports from China had increased 192% between 2006-07 and 2013-14, when they had crossed$51 billion, he pointed out. Intermediate goods account for more than a third of India’s imports from China, while capital goods constitute another 19.3%, with telecom and power sector equipment being the key drivers, which helped meet domestic demand in these fast-expanding sectors, the official said. The major items of import from China are electronic components, computer hardware and peripherals, telecom instruments, organic chemicals, industrial machinery for dairy, residual chemicals and allied products, electronic instruments, bulk drugs and intermediates. “India’s dependence on such Chinese goods can be attributed largely to the gap between the domestic production and demand, and China being a manufacturing hub and having price competitiveness due to economies of scale and subsidies provided by its government to Chinese industry,” the official noted. The production-linked incentive schemes for different sectors will help reduce the dependence on such imports over time, even as technical regulations framed for products such as toys, electronics, chemicals and fertilizers will check sub-standard imports, he emphasised.

Well, it may have slipped up and caused its own untimely demise, but that doesn’t mean that cloud gaming itself is done for. In fact, services like Nvidia GeForce NOW and Amazon Luna are alive and well. Well, much of that outcome remains to be seen as each company is currently seizing an opportunity to snag Stadia’s audience of nomad gamers who are currently looking for the best alternative. Just this week, GeForce added direct touchscreen gameplay controls – a feature Google brought to the table and innovated on first. Also, Amazon is working overtime to make Luna an attractive replacement for the failed cloud gaming platform. Can “The other guys” carry cloud gaming? So, the question on everyone’s mind, and one that I intend to answer today is “will these other services fail as Stadia has?” Aside from Netflix and its cloud gaming business that it’s trying to spin up over the next few years which will undoubtedly fail for several reasons , I think the answer is “no, not exactly”. I wouldn’t even say that Stadia “failed”. However, it’s not that simple, and while each of these offerings may come and go, they will each help shape the identity and the future of cloud gaming as a whole. Playing games on someone else’s computer from a distance and paying them for it is nothing new. In fact, it all started back with OnLive and although it was before its time, it went on directly to influence Gaikai, which then was bought by Sony and transformed into PlayStation Now, and then PlayStation Plus Premium. It’s not the best service, but it’s one of the juggernauts that’s taken over the space and has the public eye. If it weren’t for OnLive, none of the cloud gaming providers we have today would believe in the possibilities. Stadia had its chance and screwed it up The same could be said for Stadia. Its technology may go on to do better things , and I say that’s a win, despite how I feel about what Google did to the community, its employees, and its partners. It’s certainly left its mark on the industry for better and for worse. More people now believe in cloud gaming than ever before, and while it’s drawn a fair additional amount of criticism for its execution (and its “execution”), the good that it’s done can’t be understated. With more money and more innovative minds working around the clock to create unique experiences and infrastructure, things have moved along a lot faster than they would have otherwise. Others will crop up in its place Actually, that’s precisely my point. Anyone with a pocket full of cash and a strategy – either short-term or long-term – has a golden opportunity right now to be a pioneer in this space. They have a responsibility, and as Uncle Ben says in Spiderman, “With great power, comes great responsibility”. In Google’s case, “irresponsibility”. Amazon has long since been in the gaming space, and I don’t believe it do Luna dirty like Google did Stadia. Even when Google mutilated YouTube Gaming, Twitch was on the rise and getting lots of dedicated attention (no, we’re not talking about Twitch’s latest controversy today). The same can be said for Nvidia – GeForce NOW has been doing fantastic, gaining new features with little to no mob standing outside its headquarters with pitchforks and torches. The company has made graphics cards for gamers for decades, what did you expect? Hosting a cloud gaming service just makes sense for them! Google understands technology, not people Google seems to be the only oddball out here. A search company that’s transitioned to Ai, and has its fingers in literally every other pie (“ my germs! “) while simultaneously feigning dedication to the gaming space and community without truly committing to it couldn’t possibly have hoped to keep traction and build an empire. That’s Google’s main issue – it wants to be everything to everyone, but it doesn’t take the time to understand the community engrained in each space, and that’s why it always fails. Amazon Luna and Nvidia GeForce NOW may very well make the same mistakes and lose their footing in time. Actually, as they add the same features and make many of the same moves, I worry that they may also shut down one day, but as with Stadia, that’s not really the point. All technology is greater than the sum of its parts, and as consumers, we must realize this and adapt. A double-edged sword Cloud gaming has only taken off because of the big guys and their wallets, but that’s also the very reason it’s struggling. It’s a double-edged sword and one we must swallow from both ends without getting cut. I believe we’ll figure it out eventually, but we’re in the “awkward haircut stage” of things, and will grow out of it toward maturity with time. Others will come along in place of those that give up on cloud gaming, and as gamers, we must not avoid the technology just because it’s going through a rough time right now. I see a lot of YouTubers – especially those who are retro and physical game collectors rejoicing that Stadia died, and I don’t believe that’s the right response. Whatever comes next, we should all support it while engaging in important conversations about how it will unfold and serve the audience. History in the making Just because cloud gaming exists, that doesn’t mean you can’t support physical media, though I do understand the argument of companies leaning into it and away from discs if the cloud succeeds. Honestly though, I see innovation as an unstoppable force, regardless of what the old heads like myself and others want to happen. It’s my belief that we have the power to make cloud gaming what it will eventually become, and we have a responsibility as the end users to make it the best it could be by participating in history and giving feedback. I encourage you all to try out both Nvidia GeForce NOW, Amazon Luna, and hell, even Netflix gaming as it starts to take off. Enjoy games for the sake of games wherever they are because that’s what this is all about! In the meantime, become an active voice for what you want and what you don’t want as it takes shape – we’re witnessing history in the making in the same way that we did as kids when the original Nintendo launched in North America.

The Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported earnings of $3.3 billion from July through September, compared with $2.42 billion a year earlier. The increase was fueled largely by a 24% sales increase in the U.S., GM's most profitable market. The company said it is seeing improved supplies of computer chips and other parts, allowing it to build more vehicles and increase inventory on dealer lots. It's also selling more expensive pickup trucks and large SUVs. That boosted revenue for the quarter by 56% to a record $41.89 billion, though that's still short of the $42.1 billion that Wall Street had expected, according to a survey by FactSet. More than 80% of GM's revenue came from North America. Excluding one-time items, GM made $2.25 per share, beating estimates of $1.88. GM reiterated its full-year net income guidance between $9.6 billion and $11.2 billion. GM still expects pretax income of $13 billion to $15 billion. Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said the company isn't seeing any sign that demand for new vehicles is slowing despite higher interest rates and inflation. \"Pricing remains strong, demand remains strong for our products,\" he told reporters early Tuesday. Shares rose 2% after the opening bell. GM finished and shipped about 75% of the 90,000 vehicles it built without one part or another in the second quarter . Dealer inventory as of Sept. 30 rose to 359 million, up from 248 million in the second quarter. \"Overall chips are getting better than certainly where they were a year ago,\" Jacobson said. The company has not seen any signs of a recession, but it's continuing to watch the economy, Jacobson said. It has no plans to cut any workers, but is being selective in hiring, he said. Yet rising interest rates and high gasoline prices, coupled with persistent inflation, could hurt GM from now into 2023. Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau wrote in a note to investors that although sales have improved, they have yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. It's hard to predict how interest rates and inflation will affect consumer spending in the coming year, he said in an interview. Historically, rising interest rates present difficulty for automakers. \"Consumers have higher costs , and they tend to maybe pull back on purchases, look for cheaper alternatives,\" Windau said. Auto prices, he said, may have to drop \"as consumers become more focused on their financial situation and what they're willing to bite off from a payment perspective.\" The entire auto industry has been hit hard by shortages of computer chips and other parts since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The industry shuttered plants early in the pandemic, but they came back faster than expected, and by then, the semiconductor industry had switched to making chips for computers, games and other consumer electronics . The auto industry has been trying to get more chips ever since. Windau wrote that the virus is still affecting the supply chain and could cause further issues. GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts that although parts supplies are improving, the company faces challenges to get chips and other parts. \"It's still very tight,\" she said. \"Even a small hiccup usually has an impact.\" GM's joint venture in China is recovering from pandemic lockdowns, with about $330 million in equity income versus $270 million last quarter. The company's Cruise autonomous vehicle unit lost nearly $500 million as it expands a self-driving ride-hailing service from San Francisco into Austin, Texas, and Phoenix. There also was an accounting change for employee stock compensation. The company said it expects Cruise to generate $1 billion in revenue in 2025. Barra said buyers of GM's electric vehicles should be eligible for half of a $7,500 federal tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act as early as January. The law requires that batteries and vehicles be made in North America, which GM already meets. But 40% of the battery metals have to be mined or recycled on the continent, and those rules become more strict over time. \"We'll ramp up to have full qualification in the next two to three years, getting to the full $7,500,\" Barra said.

The regulator told Google to pay 9.36 billion rupees ($113.5 million) and to allow Play Store developers to use third-party payment systems for app and in-app purchases.After a lengthy investigation, the Competition Commission of India said Google's requirement for Play Store developers to use its billing system “constitutes an imposition of unfair condition,” as TechCrunch reports. The regulator found that Google didn't use the billing system for its own apps, which it said constituted an “imposition of discriminatory conditions.”The agency has ordered Google to open up the Play Store to third-party payments within three months. It said Google can't impose any anti-steering provisions on app developers and mustn't hinder them from promoting apps and services to users. Likewise, the company can't restrict users from accessing developers' services and features.The Competition Commission also stated that Google must be fully transparent with Play Store developers and that it can't impose any condition on them \"which is unfair, unreasonable, discriminatory or disproportionate to the services provided to the app developers.\" Furthermore, Google will need to have a clear and transparent data collection policy, and it will not be allowed to use \"competitively relevant transaction/consumer data of apps generated and acquired\" through the Google Play Billing System to its competitive advantage.The regulator has determined that Google has a dominant position in the spheres of licensable smartphone operating systems, app stores, web searching, video hosting platforms and \"non-OS specific\" mobile web browsers. Last week, the Competition Commission fined the company $161.9 million after finding that Google abused Android's dominance. It said smartphone makers shouldn't have to preinstall Google's apps and that the company shouldn't withhold Play Services APIs and monetary and other incentives from other parties.Google reportedly has a 97 percent smartphone market share in India, while Google Play is one of the most popular payments services. India is the company's largest market in terms of user numbers.

Known as forever chemicals because they last thousands of years, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS, are a group of synthetic organic contaminants used in a variety of industrial processes and consumer products , including non-stick cookware coatings, food wrappers, water-resistant clothing, and furniture textiles. When these products are used, discarded, or improperly dumped, PFAS leach into water systems . Once there, they are incredibly difficult to treat because of unique chemical properties imparted by carbon-fluorine bonds—some of the strongest in chemistry. The precise amount of PFAS in the country's drinking water is unknown, but experts say that it ranges from widespread to almost ubiquitous. Long-term, low-concentration exposure to PFAS can hamper the immune system , interfere with hormones, and reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. It can also cause low birth weight and high cholesterol. Those who are exposed to high doses of PFAS at work or because they live near a dumping site are at increased risk for kidney cancer, liver damage, testicular cancer, and thyroid disease. The team compared two of the most promising types of separation media—granular-activated carbon and anion exchange resins—to remove PFAS. They systematically evaluated how well each of these worked for different types of PFAS in pilot municipal water treatment plants for 15 months, concluding that the resins were more effective in removing most of the tested PFAS. \"You can think of the treatments as being large-scale versions of the filters people use at home to purify their own drinking water. Water is continuously fed from the top, and we measure the amount of time before we start to detect PFAS coming out of the end of the filter,\" says Steven Chow, research associate in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins and first author of the study. The results appeared in Water Research . The researchers say that the study is promising because it provides one of the most in-depth laboratory analyses of a large-scaled engineered PFAS treatment system to date. Normally, laboratory research has limitations in practical applicability because it's conducted on a small-scale over limited time. And many large-scale engineered systems run by drinking water utilities do not have the luxury of in-depth analysis of their systems beyond regulatory requirements, the engineers say. \"Our collaboration between academia, industry, and municipal partners allowed the team to answer fundamental questions on how these separation media work while demonstrating their effectiveness under real-world conditions,\" Chow says. While the technical outlook for filtering PFAS from drinking water is promising, the researchers warn that there are caveats. Building and operating such systems can cost millions of dollars, which is in addition to the cost of existing water treatment operations. Once the PFAS are removed, the contaminants and the filter used to collect them must be properly handled and disposed of, and because PFAS molecules are so strong, an incredible amount of energy is required to destroy them. Chow maintains that when it comes to PFAS, prevention may be the best cure. \"PFAS are a generational environmental problem that will take decades to manage and may never be completely solved,\" he says. \"The key is forward-thinking policies to that reduce the total amount of PFAS released in the environment and prevent a regrettable substitution of known PFAS with chemicals of unknown or potentially worse outcomes.\" The research team also included Kellogg J. Schwab, professor, and Carsten Prasse, assistant professor, both of the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering. The study was conducted in collaboration with the Canada-based environmental engineering company Stantec.

But Verstappen fought back to pass last season's rival for the championship on lap 50 of 56. Verstappen then had to hold off the pestering Hamilton through the final laps as his team warned him not to exceed track limits that would draw a penalty. The win was a relief for Red Bull. The team had announced shortly before qualifying on Saturday that Mateschitz had died at age 78. Verstappen vowed he'd give everything to get the win to honour him. \"We gave it everything out there, it was a difficult weekend for us,\" Verstappen said. \"The only thing we could do today was win.\" \"This one is definitely dedicated to Dietrich,\" Verstappen said. \"I pushed it to the limit to come back.\" The win continued Verstappen's run of dominance in 2022. He had already clinched the season championship in Japan two weeks earlier. Sunday's win tied him with Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel for most in a season with three races still to go.

Apart from him, Hasan Mahmud chipped in well with two wickets while captain Shakib Al Hasan and Soumya Sarkar picked a wicket each too. Netherlands were also hurt by two run-outs early in their chase, which almost derailed their chase. Colin Ackermann stood up to be the lone fighter for the Netherlands with a valiant 48-ball 62 and Van Meekeren gave Bangladesh a scare with a late cameo of 24 off 14 balls, but it wasn't enough for the Netherlands to chase down the total, skittled out for 135 in 20 overs. In defence of 144, Ahmed dismissed Vikramjit Singh on the first delivery of the innings, as the youngster was caught brilliantly at first slip. He then followed it up with a short outswinger and forced Bas de Leede to poke at it, giving the keeper a regulation catch behind to give Bangladesh a rollicking start. In the fourth over, opener Max O'Dowd and Tom Cooper were run-out after suffering bad mix-ups, resulting in two run-outs for the Netherlands in a span of three balls. Amidst the ruins, Ackermann struck boundaries off the pacer to add 44 runs for the fifth wicket with captain Scott Edwards. But once Edwards fell after reverse-sweeping to point off Shakib in the 13th over, it led to another slide for the Netherlands despite Ackermann hitting boundaries and reaching his fifty with literally no support from the other end. Ackermann's excellent knock came to an end in the 17th over when he holed out to deep mid-wicket to be Ahmed's fourth victim of the match. Van Meekeren played the long handle to perfection to hit three fours and a six, but he slog-swept straight to deep mid-wicket on the final ball of the innings off Sarkar to give Bangladesh a winning start to their campaign. Brief scores: Bangladesh 144/8 in 20 overs (Afif Hossain 38, Najmul Hossain Shanto 25; Paul van Meekeren 2/21, Bas de Leede 2/29) beat Netherlands 135 all out in 20 overs (Colin Ackermann 62, Paul van Meekeren 24; Taskin Ahmed 4/25, Hasan Mahmud 2/15) by nine runs.

Robert Lewandowski added a third in the 22nd minute and Bilbao weren't helped by Ander Herrera limping off injured. Herrera's replacement Dani Garcia also had to go off injured in what was a relatively tepid second half which saw Ferran Torres score Barca's fourth following a pass from Dembele. Atletico Madrid moved third after a 2-1 win away to Real Betis thanks to two goals from Antoine Griezmann. The Frenchman's first goal was a near-post corner that nobody was able to cut out, and his second was a finish from a narrow angle that went through the legs of Betis keeper Rui Silva. Nabil Fekir pulled a goal back for Betis with six minutes left, but the home side were unable to find an equalizer, leaving Betis coach Manuel Pellegrini to complain Atletico had taken the lead \"without even having a shot on target.\" Ten-man Villarreal won at home to Almeria in a dramatic game. Almeria opened the scoring in the 31st minute thanks to Gonzalo Melero. Alex Baena scored Villarreal's equaliser in the 56th minute, but was then harshly sent off for a second yellow card after lifting his shirt to show a message of support for the club's former vice president, who died last week. Villarreal held on with 10 men and got their reward in the 94th minute when Nicholas Jackson scored the winner from a Dani Parejo cross. Elche remain bottom of the table, but took a valuable 2-2 draw away to Espanyol, who continue to struggle for a win. Pere Milla put Elche ahead early in the game, but although Javi Puado and Martin Braithwaite turned it around for Espanyol, Gonzalo Verdu snatched an equalizer with seven minutes left to play. Girona climbed out of the bottom three with a 1-1 draw at home to Osasuna, with defender David Lopez scoring a 46th minute goal to cancel out Kike Barja's opener for the visitors, six minutes earlier. On Saturday, Real Madrid had a convincing 3-1 win at home to Sevilla, with Luka Modric putting them ahead in the fourth minute. Madrid dominated the first half, but were stunned by Erik Lamela's 53rd-minute goal for Sevilla, before Vinicius set up substitute Lucas Vazquez for Madrid's second in the 78th minute and Fede Valverde continued his excellent recent form with another powerful shot to make it 3-1. Lee Kang-in scored an 83rd-minute winner against his former club as Mallorca came back from a goal down to stun Valencia 2-1 at the Mestalla Stadium.

The Public Notice stated that “The UGC is committed to the goal of developing a safe, secure and violence free environment in all the educational institutions across the country. It has been reviewing the safety of the campus communities especially women from time to time and issuing guidelines for the same. In this regard, the UGC again set up a committee in 2022 and tasked it with reviewing and updating the safety guidelines for implementation.” The guidelines are broadly classified into two interlinked domains infrastructural facilities and amenities for a safe and secure environment and women cells for sensitisation, policy implementation, monitoring and grievance redressal. The list of some of the guidelines issued by the UGC for the women students that are also under the NEP (National Education Policy 2020) are: 1. Students should be provided with a handbook at the time of admission that would contain detailed information about rules and regulations regarding proper conduct and behaviour expected of them 2. Professional counselling services should be available on campus to address the psychological and emotional concerns of the students 3. Safety of women is a paramount concern for all. The higher education choices are, quite often, limited by perceptions of risk involved in going “outside” the home for higher education 4. The HEIs should ensure easy access to basic sanitation and hygiene facilities for women such as clean, well maintained and fully functioning separate restrooms equipped with 24 hours tap water supply, soap, covered dustbins, sanitary pad disposal bins and vending machines in all its buildings 5. The campus and the adjoining areas should be well-lit. Sports and other playgrounds and public parks should have flood lights 6. The HEIs should provide reliable and consistent transport facilities and feeder buses for all students, especially for women students and female staff, for safe transit within the campus Recent safety concerns of women in HEIs The students of NIT Trichy staged a protest recently since only students from the girls' hostel had curfews in place which denied them access to common campus facilities such as labs and libraries at night. A few weeks ago, a canteen worker from IIT Bombay climbed up the wall to the girl's hostel and peeked into the hostel bathroom. In another instance, at Chandigarh University, a girl from the hostel allegedly leaked videos of other students in the hostel bathroom which led to protests in the University. edexlive\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/ugc-frames-new-guidelines-on-safety-of-women-in-educational-institutions/","tags":[],"title":"UGC frames new guidelines on safety of women in educational institutions"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Dhoni Entertainment forays into Tamil film production Dhoni Entertainment will be producing its first film in Tamil, a family entertainer conceptualised by Sakshi Singh Dhoni\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/dhoni-entertainment-forays-into-tamil-film-production/","tags":[],"title":"Dhoni Entertainment forays into Tamil film production"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Kishore on Kantara row: ‘Think for a moment before falling prey…’ indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/kishore-on-kantara-row-think-for-a-moment-before-falling-prey/","tags":["Entertainment","Regional"],"title":"Kishore on Kantara row: ‘Think for a moment before falling prey…’"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Realme 10 Series Specifications Surface Again, Tipped to Launch in November The TENAA listings of the Realme 10 5G and Realme 10 Pro+ 5G have been updated to reveal the specifications of the two smartphones.

Speaking about the release on a pan-India scale, three national multiplex chains feature Ram Setu selling around 39,000 tickets over its advance booking period.

Here\u0026rsquo;s a look at the first Indian-origin PM\u0026rsquo;s journey The 42-year-old has his roots in India and is the husband of Akshata Murty, daughter of Infosys Founder NR Narayan Murty\nRishi Sunak! The new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK). While India was involved in bursting crackers and lighting up the sky during Diwali, Rishi Sunak also contributed to this celebration by becoming the UK PM on Monday, October 24, 2022. The celebrations for Diwali 2022 started off fantastically with India clinching a fabulous win against Pakistan in ICC World Cup T20 2022 on Sunday, October 23 and the UK getting its first Indian-origin PM the next day resulted in more celebrations. The 42-year-old has scripted history by becoming the first Indian-origin UK PM and not to forget, the first PM of colour too. Having said that, who is Sunak? And is he really from India? #WhatTheFAQ is here to give details on these and a lot more. How did this happen? It all started in July 2022, when Sunak participated in the Conservative Party leadership race to replace Boris Johnson. The fight was between Sunak and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on July 20. Truss ended up becoming the new PM defeating Sunak. Now, following the resignation of Truss on October 20 in the wake of high tax cuts, mini-budget and so on, the political fight was between Sunak, Boris Johnson and Penelope Mary Mordaunt, Leader of the House of Commons. With Johnson dropping out of the race and Sunak getting the support from Members of Parliament on October 22, he was declared as the new Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on October 23. The highlight of his oath-taking was that he was the first Hindu-origin PM. Additionally, the MP from Yorkshire Sunak took oath on the Bhagavad Gita in Parliament and he was the first UK parliamentarian to take an oath on the Gita. So, Punjab da putar becomes UK PM? The 42-year-old was born on May 12, 1980, in Southampton, Hampshire to African-born Hindu parents of Indian descent, namely, Yashvir Sunka and Usha Sunak. While Yashvir was a National Health Service General Practitioner, Usha Sunak ran a chemist shop. Having said that, how is the eldest son of the Sunak family of Indian origin? His roots can be traced to the Punjab province of British India as his grandparents lived there and migrated to the UK in the 1960s. Paternal grandparents: Ramdas Sunak from Gujranwala (in present-day Pakistan) moved to Nairobi in 1935 to work as a clerk. In 1937, he married Suhag Rani Sunak from Delhi Maternal grandparents: Raghubir Sain Berry MBE, worked in Tanganyika as a tax official and was married to Tanganyika-born Sraksha. In 1996, they along with their three children, moved to the UK and Raghubir joined the Inland Revenue, and as a collector, was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1988. Also, in 2009, Rishi married Akshata Murty, daughter of India's richest businessman and the Founder of the technology company Infosys NR Narayana Murthy who is married to Sudha Murthy, a well-known author, philanthropist and an Indian educator. Rishi Sunak and Akshata are blessed with two daughters: Krishna and Anoushka. What is his educational and political history? Sunak attended Stroud School and Winchester College where he was a head boy. During the summer holidays, he worked as a waiter at a curry house in Southampton. Later, he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Lincoln College, Oxford. During his university time, he pursued an internship at Conservative Campaign Headquarters. Followed by securing an MBA from Stanford University in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar. It was while pursuing his MBA that he met his wife, Akshata Murthy. Political career 2015: Elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond in North Yorkshire 2015-17: Member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee 2016: At the June 2016 EU membership referendum, Sunak supported Brexit, that is, the UK leaving the European Union (EU), a supranational political and economic union of 27 member states 2017: Re-elected again and served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of state for local government between January 2018 and July 2019 2019: Appointed as Chief Secretary to the Treasury by then Prime Minister Boris Johnson on July 24 2020: On February 13, promoted to Chancellor as part of a cabinet reshuffle 2022: Amid the government crisis, following Jhonson's resignation, on July 5 Sunak resigned as chancellor What are the world leaders saying? These are a few of the many leaders who took to Twitter to express their best wishes: PM of India Narendra Modi: \"As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues, and implementing Roadmap 2030.\" European Council President Charles Michel: \"Working together is the only way to face common challenges... and bringing stability is key to overcoming them.\" Irish PM Micheál Martin said he is looking forward to working with Mr Sunak, \"on the important issues we face on these islands and globally\". US President Biden described Mr Sunak's nomination as the UK's next prime minister as a \"ground-breaking milestone\" What's in store for the Indian-origin PM? Sunak now faces the enormous challenge of steering the UK economy through massive inflationary turbulence and also uniting the different wings of a divided Conservative Party. Moreover, during his campaigning for the PM post, he faced criticism for his lavish house, expensive suits and shoes. Also, he has a net worth of over 700 million pounds and is vested in properties in the UK. Apart from owning a mansion in Yorkshire, he owns a property in Kensington in Central London.\nedexlive\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/whatthefaq-rishi-sunak-is-uks-new-pm-heres-a-look-at-the-first-indian-/","tags":[],"title":"#WhatTheFAQ: Rishi Sunak is UK's new PM.

Other members include Anamaria Berea, a research affiliate at the SETI (Search for Intelligence Life) Institute in Mountainview, California; retired NASA astronaut and test pilot Scott Kelly; and others ranging from oceanographers to astrophysicists to science journalists. The panel is separate from a Pentagon group investigating UAPs reported by military pilots and investigated by US defense and intelligence officials.

We already know the phones will pack some top-of-the-line specifications on the three models in the series. Redmi has now dropped a new piece of information, saying the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G — the highest-end phone in the series — will feature a 200-megapixel camera in the rear system. The upcoming Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G will come with a 200-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL HPX sensor, the company confirmed in a post on Weibo. This is a 1/1.4-inch sensor with a 2.24μm pixel size. Samsung announced the HPX sensor recently, which makes the upcoming Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G probably the first phone with that sensor. According to Redmi, the Samsung ISOCELL HPX sensor is about 24 percent bigger than the Sony IMX766, which should mean it will let more light in. The Redmi Note 12 Pro is expected to get the Sony IMX766 sensor. What to expect Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G’s rear camera system looks very similar to the previous generation phone, but the company has not confirmed anything else. We know it is launching in China, but a new leak also suggests that the phone’s India launch may not be far away. According to tipster Mukul Sharma, Redmi has got the Redmi Note 12 series certified on the website of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The phone with model number 22101316I, where “I” stands for India, has appeared on the platform. Meanwhile, the phone’s global variant with model number 22101316G has cropped up on the IMEI database, which means the company is also planning a global launch of the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G. While the two listings confirm the launch of these phones in markets outside of China, they do not reveal if the Indian and global variants will be any different from the Chinese model of the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G. We will hopefully find out more about the Redmi Note 12 series in the coming days.

The billionaire insisted the United Kingdom’s current economic woes are the result of a poorly negotiated Brexit deal and not the Liz Truss government’s controversial tax cut proposals. Billionaire Says Poor Brexit Deal Is Source of UK’s Economic Woes The British billionaire investor Guy Hands has warned that Britain needs to renegotiate Brexit if it is to avoid seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a report has said. According to Hands, Britain’s poorly negotiated exit from the European Union is the primary cause of the United Kingdom’s ongoing economic woes. As per a report by The Telegraph, Hands believes Britain’s period of economic pain — which seemingly reached its crescendo when the pound fell to its lowest exchange rate versus the dollar — started six years ago and could eventually see the country become “the sick man of Europe.” While Britain might not need the bailout right away, Hands, founder of private equity firm Terra Firma, insists seeking such financial assistance will become a reality if U.K. ministers fail to renegotiate the Brexit deal. Hands warned about the current course of the country: Steadily increasing taxes, steadily reducing benefits and social services, higher interest rates and eventually the need for a bailout from the IMF. Hands, who is a supporter of the ruling Conservative Party, reportedly suggested that he does not think the outgoing Liz Truss government’s tax cut proposals are to blame for the United Kingdom’s financial mess. Hands: Conservatives Must Own Up to Their Mistake Tax cut proposals by Kwasi Kwarteng — the United Kingdom’s former chancellor of the exchequer — reportedly spooked financial markets, causing the pound to fall to its lowest ever level versus the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, the billionaire investor suggested there has to be some reckoning that the Brexit deal is poor and that it only put Britain on a disastrous economic path. In his remarks directed at the Conservative Party, which has since chosen Rishi Sunak to become the UK’s next prime minister, the billionaire said: “I think if the Tory party can own up to the mistake in how they negotiated Brexit and have somebody leading it that actually has the intellectual capability and the authority to negotiate Brexit, there is a possibility of turning around the economy, but without that the economy is frankly doomed.” After touching a low of 1.03 per one dollar, the pound has since recovered and is trading at £1:$1.13 at the time of writing.

The digital asset achieved a milestone on November 10, 2021 when it attained its all-time high (ATH) value of $69,044 which pushed its total market capitalization to over $1.2 trillion. The crypto, however, has suffered great losses since then, losing 72% of its ATH as it continues to struggle to initiate a bullish run. At press time, according to tracking from Coingecko, BTC is trading at $19,341 and is down by over 68% on a year-to-date basis. Its market cap was also affected by the severe price dump, plummeting all the way down to $371 billion. But despite all of these, Bitcoin was still able to keep its status as the largest cryptocurrency in terms of overall valuation. It also continues to show its dominance, outperforming almost all major assets for the third quarter of 2022. Crypto Juggernaut Steady Despite Bearish Market Coingecko, a digital currency price and information data platform, recently released an update as to how Bitcoin and some major assets as well as fiat currencies performed three months after the first half of 2022. The analysis involved the market capitalization of BTC, US Dollar Index (DXY), Crude Oil, Gold, Japanese Yen and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT). Among all the assets involved, only DXY managed to tally gains, increasing its market cap by 7% during the 3rd quarter of the year. Image: CoinCentral Bitcoin, ranking 2nd behind the US Dollar Index, had its overall valuation dip by 1% over the last three months. Despite the drop, the cryptocurrency managed to buck its current bearish market to perform better than crude oil and gold as well as TLT and the Japanese Yen. Still, the leading crypto fails in comparison to the overall market cap of gold which currently stands at $10.928 trillion. Bitcoin: Still A Long Climb To Reclaim Lost Glory While holders and investors appreciate these kinds of victories that Bitcoin earn and put under its belt, it’s undeniable that the asset dubbed as “digital gold” still has lots of work to do if it hopes to cement its status as the future of money. According to the 5-day forecast of Coincodex, BTC is expected to slightly increase its trading price to $19,440. But the 30-day prediction for the digital asset is bleak as it points at another significant price dump to trade at $15,117. Should this trend continue, Bitcoin’s 4th quarter performance could be worse than the showing it had during the months of July, August and September. Traders, investors and holders are all still looking forward with hopes that the cryptocurrency will emulate its previous bullish runs and deliver sizable gains and profits for them.

The recall also covers brands such as Nexxus, Suave, Tresemmé and Tigi, which makes Rockaholic and Bed Head dry shampoos, according to a notice posted on the Food and Drug Administration’s website Friday. Unilever’s recall pertains to products made prior to October 2021. The move once again raises questions about the safety of aerosols in personal-care products. In the past year and a half, a number of aerosol sunscreens have been pulled from shelves, such as Johnson \u0026 Johnson’s Neutrogena, Edgewell Personal Care Co.’s Banana Boat and Beiersdorf AG’s Coppertone along with spray-on antiperspirants like Procter \u0026 Gamble Co.’s Secret and Old Spice and Unilever’s Suave. The recalls were set off by findings of benzene in such products by an analytical lab called Valisure, based in New Haven, Connecticut, starting in May 2021. This isn’t the first time spray-on dry shampoo has been identified as a problem. P\u0026G tested its whole portfolio of aerosol products following Valisure’s findings. The company then recalled its Pantene and Herbal Essences dry shampoos in December, citing benzene contamination. “Given what we’ve seen, it unfortunately makes sense that other consumer-product categories, like aerosol dry shampoos, could be heavily affected by benzene contamination and we are actively investigating this area,” said Valisure Chief Executive Officer David Light. The problem with aerosols has largely appeared to be from the propellants used to spray the personal-care products from the cans. Unilever said this was the case with its dry shampoo recall. The company did not release the amount of benzene found in the products, though said it was recalling them out of an abundance of caution. The FDA said “daily exposure to benzene in the recalled products at the levels detected in testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences.” Yet the agency also said exposure to benzene can result in leukemia and other blood cancers. Spray-on personal-care products like dry shampoos often contain propellants like propane and butane, which are petroleum distillates made by refining crude oil. Benzene is a known contaminant of petroleum products. The FDA has confirmed propellants are a potential source of benzene contamination. While the FDA hasn’t set benzene limits for cosmetics like dry shampoo, it does say the products shouldn’t contain “any poisonous or deleterious substance.”\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/dove-other-unilever-aerosol-dry-shampoos-recalled-over-cancer-risk/","tags":[],"title":"Dove, other Unilever aerosol dry shampoos recalled over cancer risk"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Henry Cavill confirms DC future as Superman after cameo in Black Adam indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/henry-cavill-confirms-dc-future-as-superman-after-cameo-in-black-adam/","tags":["Entertainment","Hollywood"],"title":"Henry Cavill confirms DC future as Superman after cameo in Black Adam"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"OnePlus Nord N300 5G with MediaTek processor, 5000mAh battery launched OnePlus Nord N300 5G smartphone is now official.

The price cap proposed and pushed by the G7 with the purpose of allowing Russian oil to continue flowing, but at lower than market prices, still has many details to be hashed out, Birol said at the Singapore International Energy Week, as carried by Reuters. Last month, the G7 group of the most industrialized nations agreed to finalize and implement a price cap on Russian oil, aiming to reduce Vladimir Putin’s oil revenues for his war chest. The G7 will ban maritime transportation services for Russian oil unless the products are purchased at or below a certain price cap. European Union ambassadors also endorsed the price cap after reaching an agreement earlier this month to impose a new package of sanctions on Russia, including banning maritime transportation for Russian oil to third-party countries unless the oil is sold below or at a certain price cap. Many analysts and experts doubt that the price cap would serve its dual purpose of cutting revenues for Putin while keeping Russian oil flowing because top importers China and India haven’t signed onto the price cap, and because Putin could simply make good on his promise to halt all energy supply—including crude, fuels, natural gas, and coal—to the countries that sign up to cap the price of Russian oil. Last week, a U.S. Treasury official and industry representatives admitted to Reuters that Russia could largely evade the price cap because it would likely have access to enough own tankers and transport and insurance services to ship its oil. There have been estimates that Russia could continue to ship 80-90% of its oil outside the price cap regime, and those estimates “are not unreasonable,” the unnamed U.S. official told Reuters .

While users are facing inconvenience for the inability to send messages and make WhatsApp calls, Meta has finally come out with a statement explaining the same. Meta, which also owns Facebook, Instagram , and Oculus, has now come out with a statement to reassure that the company is taking action on the issue and will bring it back online soon. In a statement to Reuters, a Meta spokesperson said, “We're aware that some people are currently having trouble sending messages and we're working to restore WhatsApp for everyone as quickly as possible.” Sadly, Meta hasn't given any timeline behind this outage and is unable to furnish the reason why the world's most popular messenger service is out today. As of publishing, we are still experiencing an outage of WhatsApp across the mobile app and the desktop client. WhatsApp not working: What to do now Not only WhatsApp app, but even the WhatsApp Web service is out. The WhatsApp Web interface shows the “trying to reconnect” message. Since the messenger service is out and there is no timeline furnished on when we can expect it to work, here are some alternatives to send messages or communicate with your peers/ family/colleagues. The easiest way to text your contacts is to reach out via SMS. SMS service on Jio , Vi and Airtel offer up to 100 free messages per day. However, you won't be able to send multimedia files. This is where you can use other messaging apps . You can use Telegram, Signal, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram messaging for the time being. If you use an iPhone and your contacts also use an iPhone, you can rely on Apple's iMessage to reach out to your dear ones. For those working the Google Workspace, they can also use the built-in messaging service.\nhindustantimes_tech\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/whatsapp-not-working-meta-speaks-out-this-is-the-latest-update/","tags":[],"title":"WhatsApp not working: Meta speaks out, this is the latest update"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"WhatsApp is down and messages won\u0026rsquo;t send - here\u0026rsquo;s what we know WhatsApp appears to be down, with messages not sending.

Well, success is subjective and it's a long way ahead. I pray that my conscience help me serve my people better and hence, I seek blessings and good wishes in my way ahead.\" She mentioned.

According to him, at the Central Bank of India, it is 'jungle raj' with the management resorting to indiscriminate transfers.

The Pakistani side, according to the report, made huge efforts to persuade the kingdom to honour the MoUs and invest in the South Asian nation. Islamabad also put its weight behind Riyadh, which has locked horns with Washington over the cut in oil supply in the international market, The News reported. In February 2019, during the visit of Mohammad Bin Salman to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia signed MoUs for an investment of $21 billion in various sectors of the economy, including for the project of a deep conversion refinery and petrochemical complex with an investment of $12 billion. The Saudi oil giant Aramco also conducted a study in this regard which found that setting up a refinery in Gwadar was not feasible. However, it can be established at Hub, Balochistan, or near Karachi, the official said, The News reported. Later, when the ties of Imran Khan's government got strained with Saudi Arabia, the top decision-makers of the kingdom virtually put MoUs of $21 billion on the backburner signed in February 2019, the official said. Now in the latest scenario, the official said, the Ministry of Petroleum is working on an upgrade of the draft for the refining policy to allure investment for setting up new refineries. The government is making up its mind to offer the investors profitability at 14-15 per cent against the offer of 9 per cent, earlier offered in the draft for refining policy prepared by the PTI government, apart from increasing the tax holiday's scope. The government also wants investment from China for a refinery and to this effect, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his upcoming visit to China, will offer Beijing to set up a refinery in Pakistan.

Sunak's change in fate was triggered by the resignation of Truss after her high-profile sacking and resignation in her cabinet, following a heavily criticised mini-budget that left the UK pound tumbling. After she was forced to step down just 45 days into office, Truss became the shortest-serving British PM. Standing before 10 Downing Street, Truss said that she recognizes she \"cannot deliver the mandate\" on which she was elected. Truss' ascent to power was paved by the Tory leadership crisis following Boris Johnson's resignation in July, after a series of resignations of cabinet members, who protested against his scandal-plagued leadership. Within weeks, Sunak and Truss rose to the Conservative ranks to end up as finalists for the contest for the post of UK Prime Minister. Liz Truss was later appointed as the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in September, which lasted less than 45 days. After Truss resigned on Thursday, Rishi Sunak and former Prime Minister Boris Johnson were seen as frontrunners for the UK PM bid. But Boris Johnson ruled himself out of the Conservative party leadership race despite claiming he had the required support. The former UK PM said he had come to the conclusion \"this would simply not be the right thing to do\" as \"you can't govern effectively unless you have a united party in Parliament.\" Sunak is born in Southampton to parents of Indian descent who migrated to Britain from East Africa. An Oxford, and Stanford University alumnae, Sunak is famously married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of NR Narayana Murthy, the billionaire businessman who founded Infosys. Earlier in April, reports of Akshata's non-domicile status and alleged tax evasion had created a furrow. Rishi Sunak claimed that she has been paying all taxes. Her spokesperson said that Akshata Murthy \"has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income\".

Trivedi, on Friday set aside the Gauhati High Court order granting bail to the two accused. The Gauhati High Court granted relief of bail to accused named Khalil Uddin and Md Abdul Hai alias Abdul Hai Talukdar in connection with crime registered pursuant to the Narcotics Control Bureau in respect of offences punishable under Sections 21(c) read with 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act). The High Court had released two accused on bail after they were in custody for about a year. Questioning the grant of relief to the accused, instant appeals have been preferred by NCB. \"What emerges from the record is that large quantity of contraband weighing about 13 kg of morphine was found in a car which was driven by Md. Jakir Hussain. Whether the role played by said Md. Jakir Hussain could get connected with both the accused is a question,\" the court said. The court further noted that going by the circumstances on record, at this stage, on the strength of the statement of Nizam Uddin, though allegedly retracted later, the matter stands on a different footing. \"In our considered view, in the face of the mandate of Section 37 of the Act, the High Court could not and ought not to have released the accused on bail,\" the court said. \"We, therefore, allow these appeals, set aside the view taken by the High Court and direct that both the appellants be taken in custody forthwith,\" the court said. The court also noted that the charge sheet has been filed and hence directed the trial court to take up the matter and conclude the proceedings as early as possible and preferably within six months from the receipt of this order. According to prosecution, contraband material weighing about 13 kg of morphine was found in a motor vehicle which was driven by a co-accused named Md. Jakir Hussain. During the course of the investigation, it was found that the motor vehicle was registered in the name of Md.

Apple TV+ will increase by $2 per month (if you pay monthly) or $10 per year (if you pay yearly). The new prices are $6.99 per month or $69 per year. Apple Music's price hike is $1 for individuals and $2 for families, thus the new prices are $10.99 per month for the individual plan and $16.99 per month for the family plan. Finally, the Apple One bundle, which includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, iCloud+, Apple News+, and Apple Fitness+, is going up by $2 for the individual plan (now $16.95 per month up from $14.95), $3 for the family plan (now $22.95 per month up from $19.95), and also $3 for the Premier plan (now $32.95 up from $29.95). An Apple spokesperson provided TechCrunch with the following statement regarding the price increases: The subscription prices for Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple One will increase beginning today. The change to Apple Music is due to an increase in licensing costs, and in turn, artists and songwriters will earn more for the streaming of their music. We also continue to add innovative features that make Apple Music the world’s best listening experience. We introduced Apple TV+ at a very low price because we started with just a few shows and movies. Three years later, Apple TV+ is home to an extensive selection of award-winning and broadly acclaimed series, feature films, documentaries, and kids and family entertainment from the world’s most creative storytellers. These prices are obviously all for the US market, but there's no reason to believe international markets won't see proportionally similar price hikes too.

As the team continues to draw the ire of fans, Russell Westbrook finds himself in a dire situation. The 33-year-old point guard’s struggles from the field make him the poster boy of social media trolling. Westbrook, who is 3-fo-17 in his jump shots so far, is in no mood to regulate his attempts from the field. Currently shooting 28.9% from the field, the situation has reached a point where the opposition doesn’t consider the Lakers guard worthy enough to be guarded. russell westbrook has the least-defended jumper of all-time 😨 — buckets (@buckets) It’s a sad state of affairs for Lakers Nation, who have no option but to deal with the incompetencies of the organization as a whole. A complete misfit on the roster, the potential plan of having Westbrook come off the bench is yet to see the light of day with constant speculations about it. Also read: Amid all the criticism surrounding Brodie, Lakers veteran Magic Johnson would share his words of wisdom for the former OKC superstar during an appearance on Shannon Sharpe’s Club Shay Shay Podcast. Widely regarded as one of the greatest point guards of all time, Magic played his entire career for the purple and gold, bringing the city of LA 5-championships. Thus the Hall of Famer understands the role and responsibilities of representing an iconic franchise like the Lakers. Magic’s relationship with the Lakers wasn’t only limited to that of a player. The three-time MVP also served as a coach and president for the team. Thus it was no surprise to see the 63-year-old express his disappointment with the current situation, addressing the Westbrook situation at length. . gives Russell Westbrook advice after he was once boo’d \u0026 called Tragic Magic: “First off, take accountability. If you don’t play well, admit it. Stop trying to fight the media and the fans and go out and perform.” — Club Shay Shay (@ClubShayShay) Having faced a similar situation to Westbrook in the 1984 finals against the Celtics, Magic believes Brodie needs to take responsibility for his actions and stop paying heed to the surrounding noise, stating that Lakers Nation knew their basketball. Though his resume is enough to validate his greatness, Magic did have his fair share of ups in downs. One such instance was his performance in Game Four of the 1984 Finals against the Celtics, earning him the nickname Tragic Johnson. The twelve-time All-Star would commit grave errors during the contest, which included Celtics center Robert Parish stealing the ball, followed by missing two free throws in overtime. This came at a time when Magic was already a two-time champion and Finals MVP. Nonetheless, the legendary point guard would come back stronger, defeating Larry Bird and co in the very next Finals (1985).

Kohli would then change gears in astonishing fashion, smacking 67 runs off his next 30 deliveries, including 36 runs off his last 11 balls, to finish on an unbeaten 82 off 53 balls, giving India an incredible four-wicket win. Former Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq was in awe of Kohli’s unbeaten knock , saying that the right-handed batter has his own class with an awe-inspiring ability to win matches single-handedly, especially when under pressure. “All credit for the (victory of) Indian team should be given to Virat Kohli. The way he played was fantastic. Virat is only this type of player and it’s not like that he did something which he has not done or can’t do. He played well and it was a superb knock. He has the potential that he can win matches single handedly. “There are many players who can win matches single-handedly. Some players cannot win matches despite scoring runs but there are some players who win such matches for their teams single-handedly and in pressure. Virat (Kohli) is such a player and has his own class,” said Inzamam on his Youtube channel ‘The Match Winner’. In a chasing masterclass for ages, laced with six fours and four sixes at a strike-rate of 154.72, Kohli slowly got India back in the chase and eventually get their campaign off to a winning start with unshakable belief and absolute trust in his abilities to enthrall 90,293 fans in the iconic stadium. Inzamam further claimed that Kohli’s good form, which has been present since the Asia Cup 2022 after a prolonged lean patch, can guide India to breaking their nine-year drought of an ICC trophy this year. “The Indian team is dangerous only on one condition: when Virat plays brilliantly. I am telling this clearly. There are many factors and people term other batsmen as dangerous but for me, Virat is zabardast (magnificent). If India has to win the World Cup, Virat’s performance like this can win them the World Cup. “If they think that they can win the World Cup without Virat, it’s not possible. Indian (team) performance is related to only one person. That’s Virat Kohli. India was struggling for a long time due to Virat’s poor form. Now he has come back (in good form) and it gives India an edge in upcoming matches in the World Cup.” Kohli was also involved in a 113-run stand with Hardik Pandya for the fifth wicket to lead India’s heroic recovery from 31/4, which also has the record of the highest partnership for any wicket for India against Pakistan in T20Is and set the base for a successful run chase. “Both Virat and Pandya were playing well in the partnership. The main thing was that Kohli maintained the flow after the fall of Pandya’s wicket. He did not let pressure overtake his mind. He had the pressure that he is the well set batsman but the way he played the last two overs was his class. The two sixes he hit off Haris Rauf, that was some class. “The good thing for India is that Virat has regained his form. And it happened in such a match against Pakistan. It could have happened in any World Cup match. But it happened in the first match against Pakistan only,” concluded Inzamam.

Pinto is also the global investment bank’s chief operating officer and CEO of its Corporate \u0026 Investment Bank. The 59-year-old executive grew up in Argentina as a child where inflation was often very high, he shared, noting that living with pervasive inflation was “very, very stressful.” Price increases in Argentina averaged more than 300% a year from 1975 to 1991. Pinto opined: That’s why when people say, ‘the Fed is too hawkish,’ I disagree. I think putting inflation back in a box is very important … If it causes a slightly deeper recession for a period of time, that is the price we have to pay. The JPMorgan president stressed that the Federal Reserve cannot allow inflation to become ingrained in the economy, emphasizing that a premature return to easier monetary policy risks repeating the mistakes of the 70s and 80s. Crypto Is ‘Kind of Irrelevant’ Commenting on cryptocurrency, the JPMorgan executive claims that there is little progress recently in terms of the institutional adoption of crypto. Pinto said: The reality is, the current form of crypto has become a small asset class that is kind of irrelevant in the scheme of things. However, he noted: “But the technology, the concepts, something is probably going to happen there; just not in its current form.” In contrast to Pinto’s belief, many big companies and banks are seeing increased institutional interest in crypto, and are ramping up their crypto services. Nasdaq established a crypto unit in September citing increased demand for digital assets among institutional investors. Financial giant State Street recently said that it sees unwaning demand from institutions. In May, Citi, Wells Fargo, and BNY Mellon invested in crypto firm Talos citing an acceleration in institutional adoption of crypto assets. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also believes that blockchain and decentralized finance (defi) are real. However, he said that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are “decentralized Ponzi schemes.” What do you think about the comments by JPMorgan Chase President Daniel Pinto?

Civil defence teams are deployed at Bakkhali Sea Beach in South 24 Parganas. Tourists are not allowed to visit the beach and the shops have also been closed. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday appealed to the people to \"stay alert\" as there is a high chance of rain on Tuesday due to cyclone Sitrang.

The cyclonic storm \"Sitrang\" pronounced as \"Si-Trang\" over the northwest and adjoining the central Bay of Bengal crossed the Bangladesh coast between Tinkona and Sandwip close to Barisal from 9:30 pm to 11:30 pm on Monday with a maximum sustained wind speed of 80-90 kmph gusting to 100 kmph, IMD said. \"It lay centred at 11:30 pm on Sunday over coastal Bangladesh near latitude 23.70N and longitude 90.80E, about 40 km east of Dhaka, 50 km west-southwest of Agartala, and 120 km north-northeast of Barisal (Bangladesh),\" IMD officials said. \"The cyclone is very likely to continue to move north-northeastwards and weaken into a depression during next 6 hours and further into a well-marked low-pressure area during subsequent 6 hours,\" it further said.\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/cyclone-sitrang-imd-issues-red-alert-for-four-north-east-states/","tags":[],"title":"Cyclone Sitrang: IMD issues red alert for four North-East states"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Asia\u0026rsquo;s biggest buyout: Toshiba valued at $16 billion by JIP in takeover bid A consortium led by Japan Industrial Partners Inc. is considering a takeover of Toshiba Corp. at a valuation of about 2.4 trillion yen ($16.1 billion) in what could be Asia's biggest buyout this year\nA consortium led by Japan Industrial Partners Inc. is considering a takeover of Toshiba Corp. at a valuation of about 2.4 trillion yen ($16.1 billion) in what could be Asia’s biggest buyout this year, according to people familiar with the matter. The JIP-led group, which is the preferred bidder to take the Japanese industrial group private, plans to provide 1 trillion yen in cash, while seeking financing totaling 1.4 trillion yen from banks along with a committed line of credit of 200 billion yen in working capital, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. Toshiba, in its regular meeting with banks including Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. on Oct. 20, informed them that JIP is valuating the company at around 2.4 trillion yen and asked them to give financing support, the people said. Shares of Toshiba fell as much as 1.3% on Tuesday in Tokyo, giving the conglomerate a market value of about $15.6 billion. A bid at 2.4 trillion yen would be worth about 5,541 yen per share according to Bloomberg calculations, similar to Toshiba’s closing price of 5,391 per share on Monday. JIP has yet to finalize the equity commitments from its partners, while banks remain cautious about making binding commitments, the people said. Both the consortium led by JIP and a rival group led by state-backed investment fund Japan Investment Corp. will find it hard to meet a Nov. 7 deadline to line up commitment letters, Bloomberg News reported earlier. Considerations are still ongoing and there’s no certainty that talks will lead to any transaction, the people said. Toshiba could still decide to explore certain asset sales instead of a full sale of the business, they said. Spokespeople for JIP and SMBC declined to comment. A Toshiba spokesperson said in response to a Bloomberg News query that, as a general rule, they cannot answer information about candidates, including co-investors, as it may undermine a fair process. JIP is in talks to form a partnership with domestic companies including Orix Corp. and Chubu Electric Power Co. as well as global investment firms such as Baring Private Equity Asia and CVC Capital Partners, Bloomberg News has reported. That coalition has made a proposal that would keep Toshiba’s current business structure intact. Investors including Bain Capital and MBK Partners have discussed being involved in JIC’s rival bid group, people familiar with the matter have said.\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/asias-biggest-buyout-toshiba-valued-at-16-billion-by-jip-in-takeover-bid/","tags":[],"title":"Asia's biggest buyout: Toshiba valued at $16 billion by JIP in takeover bid"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Liz Truss reacts after Rishi Sunak becomes first Indian-origin British PM Rishi Sunak, 42, has become Britain's first Indian-origin Prime Minister after he won the race to lead the Conservative Party.\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/liz-truss-reacts-after-rishi-sunak-becomes-first-indian-origin-british-pm/","tags":[],"title":"Liz Truss reacts after Rishi Sunak becomes first Indian-origin British PM"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"MSU researchers receive $3 million NIH grant to study testosterone’s role in depression Major depressive disorder affects women twice as often as men, but researchers are still trying to identify the reasons why.\nMajor depressive disorder affects women twice as often as men, but researchers are still trying to identify the reasons why. Researchers at Michigan State University have recently received a $3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to continue their investigation of how male and female brains respond to stress differently and how testosterone could be the key to increasing resilience. The National Institute of Mental Health has begun to look at biological sex as a variable that could help explain some mental health disparities. Since 2016, A.J. Robison, an associate professor in the College of Natural Science and director of MSU's Neuroscience Program, and his team have been studying the effects of stress on the brain and discovered that sex and testosterone play a role. Through earlier research, we found there is a specific brain circuit in the hippocampus that is more excitable in female mice than in males. That circuit is regulated by testosterone.\" A.J. Robison, Associate Professor, College of Natural Science Robison's team includes his wife, Michelle Mazei-Robison, a co-principal investigator on the grant and associate chair of the physiology department in the College of Natural Science, along with graduate students Elizabeth \"Liz\" Williams, Claire Manning, Ivana Lakic and Chiho Sugimoto. Their research has shown that testosterone reduces the excitability of this brain circuit. \"I'm really excited to be a part of this innovative project to dissect mechanisms that contribute to sex differences in stress resiliency,\" Mazei-Robison said. \"These studies have the potential to identify targets that could be leveraged towards novel therapeutic strategies to treat mood disorders.\" Since testosterone is central to many functions in the body, the answer is not as simple as giving someone with depression a testosterone boost. By identifying how testosterone affects neurons in the circuit through either -; the signaling on the cell's surface or binding DNA in the cell's nucleus -; researchers can develop and leverage novel targets to treat depression in both sexes. \"Now, we want to know how testosterone is causing this change in the brain circuitry,\" Robison said. \"If we can figure that out, maybe one of those things is something we can use to create a female- or male-specific pharmacological treatment for depression.\" This research has also spawned new studies in related areas. For example, Andrew Eagle, a research associate in the Department of Physiology at MSU and former postdoctoral fellow of Robison, is studying how this same brain circuit is connected to the rewarding effects and relapse behaviors associated with cocaine use in the hopes of finding new treatments for substance use disorder.

This was the biggest Muhurat day gain for the sensex in terms of points, and the best in terms of percentage since 2008, index data showed.\nMUMBAI: Boosted by strong buying in banking and financial stocks, the sensex gained 525 points, or nearly 1%, to end at 59,832 during Monday’s special hour-long Muhurat trading session on the BSE. This was the biggest Muhurat day gain for the sensex in terms of points, and the best in terms of percentage since 2008, index data showed. The day also marked the start of ‘Vikram Samvat Year 2079’. Followed mainly by the Gujaratis who are a majority among the traders on Dalal Street, the Samvat year starts on the day of Diwali. Traditionally during the Muhurat session, individual traders and investors tend to buy stocks, even if in small quantities, and refrain from selling. Despite a sharp selloff in Hong Kong \u0026 Chinese markets and flat trading in European bourses, the sensex started Monday’s session on astrong note and remained in a narrow range before closing 0. 9% in the green. On the NSE, the broader Nifty closed 154 points, also 0. 9%, higher at 17,731. According to HDFC Securities MD \u0026 CEO Dhiraj Relli, the positive ending during the Muhurat session was in-line with most such sessions in the past. “Indices rose led by bank stocks, after a volatile year, aided by positive cues from European and US markets and despite the selloff in the Hong Kong and China markets. Investors hope that the positive sentiment could get carried into the new Samvat year despite some macro and global headwinds. ” On Friday, major US indices had rallied about 2% each. That turned out to be one of the main drivers for the sensex, market players said. And earlier on Monday, markets in Tokyo and Seoul closed in the green while Shanghai and Hong Kong ended sharply lower after the close of the Party Congress in China the previousevening. Hang Seng closed 6. 4% lower — its worst single-session percentage loss in a decade, reports said. The day’s winning session on Dalal Street added over Rs 2 lakh crore to investor’s wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at more than Rs 279 lakh crore. Of the 30 sensex stocks, 28 closed with gains, BSE data showed. Among the sensex stocks, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and HDFC together accounted fornearly half of the index’s gains. On the other side, losses in HUL and Kotak Bank limited the sensex’s gains, according to BSE data. On the sectoral front, BSE’s indices for capital goods, industrials, financial services, banking and telecom industries closed with gains of over 1% each, while the gauge for the FMCG industry closed in the red, becoming the only sectoral index to do so. On the day of Diwali, the BSE also began trading in electronic gold receipts (EGRs), a new product that will offer a fresh avenue for investors, jewellers and institutions to invest in the yellow metal. Since 2015, the BSE has been working collaboratively with the regulator and all market participants across India to launch various gold-based products, the exchange said in a press release.\ntoi\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/sensex-makes-biggest-muhurat-gain-in-14-years/","tags":[],"title":"Sensex makes biggest Muhurat gain in 14 years"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Katrina Kaif-Vicky Kaushal celebrate Diwali with stunning photos, netizens say \u0026lsquo;Death hi ho gayi\u0026rsquo; Katrina Kaif and Vicky Kaushal celebrated their first Diwali together and one of Bollywood's most loved couples shared their photos on social media with the fans.

Scientists at deCODE genetics, a subsidiary of Amgen, publish today a large genome-wide association study on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Nature Genetics. Sequence variants that associate with NAFLD were identified, including rare, protective loss-of-function variants that point to potential drug targets. Plasma proteomic analyses provided further insight into the pathogenesis of NAFLD. NAFLD is a growing health problem and is estimated to affect up to 25% of the world's population. Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), when over 5% of the liver is fat with no identifiable causes such as excessive alcohol consumption, is the first stage of NAFLD. NAFL can progress to non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH) which can progress further into liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD can be difficult to diagnose and monitor and there is currently no therapy available. The identification of potential drug targets and biomarkers is therefore of great importance. A large genome-wide association study of NAFL, liver cirrhosis and HCC was conducted and the findings integrated with expression and proteomic data. For NAFL, 9,491 clinical cases from Iceland, UK, USA and Finland were utilized in addition to proton density fat fraction (PDFF) extracted from 36,116 liver MRIs. Among the sequence variants discovered, in the Icelandic population, were rare, protective, predicted loss-of-function variants in MTARC1 and GPAM suggesting that inhibiting MTARC1 or GPAM could be therapeutic for NAFL or NASH. Levels of thousands of proteins measured in plasma were analyzed, identifying potential biomarkers of disease, disease progression or target engagement and models that can discriminate between a NAFL and cirrhosis were constructed using the proteomics data. The results therefore provide a path to the development of non-invasive tools to evaluate and diagnose NAFLD. Additionally, the pleiotropic effects of the identified variants were explored by looking at associations with 52 other phenotypes and traits. BMI is one of the most common risk factors of NAFLD and longitudinal PDFF measures suggested that carriers of p.Ile148Met, the well-know NAFLD risk variant, in PNPLA3 are more susceptible to change in BMI than non-carriers. To date this study is one of the largest ones conducted on the genetic basis of NAFLD and the results will hopefully contribute to the development of diagnostic tools and therapies that can help patients suffering from NAFLD. deCODE genetics Sveinbjornsson, G., et al.

University of Iowa researchers have traced where that reaction to a threat arises.\nAt one time or another, we've all felt paralyzed by a threat or danger. University of Iowa researchers have traced where that reaction to a threat arises. In a new study, the researchers confirmed a neural circuit linking two separate regions in the brain governs how animals, including humans, react to a stressful situation. Through experiments, the researchers showed how rats responded to a threat either passively or actively-;and linked each reaction to a specific pathway in the brain. In another test, the researchers successfully manipulated the neural circuit, so that rats overcame what would have been a paralyzing response to a danger and instead responded aggressively to the threat. The neural circuit identified with stress response connects the caudal medial prefrontal cortex to the midbrain dorsolateral periaqueductal gray. Clinching the connection, and how it regulates stress, is important, due to the known physical- and mental-health impacts of chronic stress. A lot of chronic stress diseases like depression and anxiety disorders are associated with what we call a passive coping behavior. We know that a lot of these conditions are caused by life stress. The simplest reason we're interested in this pathway is thinking about it as a circuit that can promote resilience against stress.\" Jason Radley, Associate Professor, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and the Study's Corresponding Author Previous research has identified the caudal medial prefrontal cortex-midbrain dorsolateral periaqueductal gray as a key pathway governing how animals respond to stress. Radley's team confirmed the pathway's importance by inactivating it, then observing how the rats responded to a threat. The rats could respond in two basic ways: One is passively, meaning in essence they did not move in response to the threat. The other is actively, through a range of behaviors, such as burying the threat (a shock probe, in the experiments), rearing up on hind legs, or seeking an escape route. The researchers learned that when they inactivated the rats' stress neural circuit, the animals responded passively, meaning they did not directly respond to the threat. \"That shows this pathway is necessary for active coping behavior,\" Radley says. Next, the researchers forced the rats to respond passively, by removing the bedding in their cage, which prevents them from trying to bury the threat mechanism. When the team activated the neural pathway, the rats switched their behavior, and responded actively to the threat. The active response occurred even though the animals were left without their bedding, which should have triggered a passive reply. Moreover, blood samples taken before and after the rats' neural circuits had been activated showed their stress hormone levels did not spike when confronted with the threat. \"What that means is by activating the pathway, we saw broad stress-buffering effects,\" Radley says. \"It not only revived the rats' active coping behaviors, it also restored them and greatly decreased stress hormone release.\" In a third set of experiments, the researchers subjected rats to chronic variable stress, meaning they were exposed to regular stress over two weeks. After the two-week conditioning, the rats were placed in cages and exposed to the threat. They responded passively, unwilling to move, and their stress hormones shot up, as the researchers had hypothesized. The chronic stress test is important, Radley says, because humans face chronic stress. For reasons that are unknown, some people continue to carry those stress burdens, which can lead to physical and mental disorders. Others, though, show little to no past memory of the chronic stress. The researchers term this behavior \"stress resilience.\" \"It's possible we can co-opt some of these brain circuits if we could understand the processes in the brain that can regulate resilience,\" Radley says, though he adds this is not an imminent option. The researchers plan to investigate the neutral connections that are upstream and downstream of the caudal medial prefrontal cortex-midbrain dorsolateral periaqueductal gray pathway. \"We don't understand how these effects are altering the brain more widely,\" Radley says. The study, \"Activity in a prefrontal-periaqueductal gray circuit overcomes behavioral and endocrine features of the passive coping stress response,\" was published online Oct. 28 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) .

The 42-year-old former chancellor was comfortably in the lead, having secured the public backing of over half the 357 Tory MPs – way above the 100 minimum required to make the shortlist. In time for the 1400 local time Monday deadline, Sir Graham Brady, chair of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, announced in the Parliament complex that he had received only one nomination and therefore Sunak is the winner of the leadership contest. This means Sunak is poised to walk through the door of 10 Downing Street in London after an audience with King Charles III in Buckingham Palace, the timeframe of which will become known soon. 1. Rishi Sunak was, until recently, widely regarded as the party’s brightest rising star, the best-known of potential leadership contenders — and the bookies’ favorite to succeed Johnson. 2. Rishi Sunak is married to British-Indian fashion designer Akshata Murthy, daughter of founder of the Indian multi-national IT company Infosys. 3. Sunak, 42, was thrust into the spotlight when he became treasury chief in 2020, tasked with the unenviable job of steering the economy through its worst economic slump on record because of the pandemic. 4. He dished out billions of pounds in emergency spending to help businesses and workers, and his policies have generally been seen in a positive light. 5. But “partygate” changed those fortunes. Like Johnson, he was issued a police fine for attending a lockdown-flouting birthday party at Downing Street in June 2020. 6. Rishi Sunak has also come under heavy criticism for being slow to respond to Britain’s severe cost-of-living crisis. 7. Born to Indian parents who moved to the UK from East Africa, Sunak attended the exclusive Winchester College private school and studied at Oxford. 8. Some see his elite education and past work for the investment bank Goldman Sachs and a hedge fund as a deficit because he seems out of touch with ordinary voters. 9. Sunak also faced pressure following revelations that his wife, Akshata Murthy, avoided paying U.K. taxes on her overseas income, and that the former investment banker held on to his U.S. green card while serving in government. 10. The 42-year-old British Indian minister posted his resignation letter on Twitter soon after another senior Cabinet colleague, UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid, resigned.

ICP monitoring is thus a key aspect of patient care in patients with these disorders. Additionally, ICP measurements are relevant when estimating cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), an indicator of cerebral autoregulation (CA). CPP is linked to neuronal function and neurovascular coupling, and CA defines how the brain maintains a constant blood flow. Given these broad implications and applications in clinical decision-making, precise ICP monitoring is a vital patient management tool. While current tools for ICP monitoring are precise, they can cause hemorrhage or infections and are time-consuming. Although noninvasive alternatives exist, they have limitations such as poor generalizability, low predictive capacity, and a lack of reliability. Thus, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) are emerging as promising noninvasive solutions. Notably, NIRS has several advantages over other noninvasive methods-;low cost, bedside compatibility for long-term and continuous monitoring, along with user independence. In a new study published in Neurophotonics , researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) successfully deployed a NIRS device to continuously monitor hemoglobin concentration changes. The team built on previous research where they estimated ICP from cardiac waveform features measured using DCS, and also identified the correlation between relative changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration and ICP. But how were they able to measure ICP using the NIRS data? First author on the study, Filip Relander, explains, \"We developed and trained a random forest (RF) regression algorithm to correlate the morphology of cardiac pulse waveforms obtained through NIRS with intracranial pressure.\" To validate their algorithm, they conducted preliminary tests in a preclinical model. They measured fluctuations in invasive ICP and arterial blood pressure while profiling the changes in hemoglobin concentrations. Following this, they examined the performance of signals derived from the hemoglobin concentration and CBF to accurately verify the precision of their algorithm. From a proof-of-concept standpoint, the results were very promising. There was a high correlation between the ICP estimated using the RF algorithm and the actual ICP measured using invasive techniques. We showed, by validating the findings with invasive ICP data, that the trained RF algorithm applied to NIRS based cardiac waveforms can be used to estimate ICP with a high degree of precision.\" Jana Kainerstorfer, Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at CMU and Study's Senior Author Furthermore, the results indicated that the RF algorithm could interpret waveform features extracted from both NIRS and DCS, highlighting its useability. The parameters used in the algorithm can be obtained from NIRS measurements, combined with electrocardiograms and mean arterial blood pressure, which are regularly used for clinical evaluation. Thus, if this RF-based platform can produce robust ICP measurements in subsequent human trials, its potential for clinical use would be tremendous. According to Neurophotonics Associate Editor Rickson C. Mesquita, Professor at the University of Campinas, \"Assessing ICP noninvasively is of great value for monitoring patients in a critical condition, such as those in the intensive care unit. The future of NIRS in this space is exciting!\" SPIE--International Society for Optics and Photonics Relander, F.A.J., et al.

In this spectacular albeit full-of-drama match, Virat Kohli played one of his best innings, scoring an unbeaten 82 runs off 53 balls to help India win off the last ball of the game. However, it seemed the match had gone out of the hands for India when seasoned Dinesh Karthik got stumped out in the penultimate delivery of the match. Ravichandran Ashwin came in when India needed 2 runs off the last ball to win this match. The spinner did not succumb to a rush of blood and used his brain brilliantly to pull the match into India’s lap. #RAshwin 's presence of mind #INDvsPAK #Kingkohli #ViratKohli #GOAT pic.twitter.com/Mb3LgrQ3Wz — rohit_msdian (@rohit_601) October 23, 2022 The Player-of-the-Match Kohli praised Ashwin for leaving a delivery bowled by Pakistan’s Muhammad Nawaz in the last over, which went on to be declared wide. From India needing 5 runs to win in three balls before that delivery was bowled, the equation came down to 2 needed in as many deliveries. While Karthik was stumped out on the next delivery, Ashwin kept his nerve to guide India to victory with a lofted shot over mid-off on the last ball. “I told Ashwin to hit...ball over covers. But Ash...usne dimaag ke upar extra dimag lagaya. That was a brave thing for him to do...The ball came inside the line and he turned it into wide,” Kohli said. Kohli said this was his best innings in T20 cricket considering the situation it came in. “Till today I have always said Mohali was my best innings, against Australia: I got 82 off 52 (51 balls). Today I got 82 off 53. So they are exactly the same innings, but I think today I will count this one higher because of the magnitude of the game and what the situation was,” he said. Kohli thanked his fans for their support during his difficult times. “You guys have supported me, shown me so much love and support for all these months that I was kind of struggling, you guys kept backing me. And I am very grateful for your support. Thank you,” said Kohli in the post-match presentation ceremony on Sunday.

To date, accessory makers have expressed frustration to AppleInsider about their lack of ability to create MagSafe chargers with other colors or different surface materials. They all have to have a white silicone charging surface which doesn't always mesh with a product's aesthetic. That is about to change. AppleInsider has been able to confirm that Apple has made some changes to its MFi program and introduced a new MagSafe module that can be covered and styled with different materials. Apple's official MFi components Any third-party manufacturer that hopes to create an accessory that uses any of Apple's connectivity methods needs to use Apple's official components and complete a rigorous certification process. Consider the Apple Watch charging puck — Apple supplies the proprietary charging module directly to the manufacturers to build into their products. And, the same goes for the Lightning connector. Then Apple takes the product and runs it through various safety and performance tests before certifying it and assigning it a dedicated ID. Apple's coveted MFi branding logos This ensures the charger is safe for your device, performs to Apple's standards, and is the same quality as if you're buying from Apple directly. You'll know one of these tested and certified devices by the tell-tale Made for iPhone (or Made for Apple Watch) logo on the side of the box. Manufacturers go to great lengths — and significant expense — to get this badge of honor and is a sign of reliability to consumers. Because MagSafe falls into this category, until recently Apple-certified MagSafe chargers to date have the same bright white, soft-touch, MagSafe surface. The charger you get from Nomad or Belkin works, looks, and feels just like Apple's but with a different design. The state of MagSafe With MagSafe, things can be confusing. Apple offers two methods of wirelessly charging iPhones with users having the choice between Qi and MagSafe. MagSafe components If you've ever come across a magnetic wireless charger that doesn't carry the Made for iPhone badge, it's just a 7.5W Qi charger with a ring of magnets. This differs from MagSafe which can charge at up to 15W. Now, Apple is introducing a new official MFi MagSafe component. As it is an official part, it has fast charging speeds but Apple will now allow the charging surface to be covered. This will pave the way for a whole new world of MagSafe chargers that don't have to be stark white and instead can be styled in all sorts of different ways. We can have MagSafe with dark profiles, premium leather surfaces, or covered in fun patterns. Anker 3-in-1 Cube with MagSafe We've already seen the first of these chargers in Anker's new 3-in-1 MagSafe cube . This ditches the white circle for a more seamless top surface with a raised rubber ring. This is the only MagSafe charger that delivers 15W of power with a non-white surface. Other accessory makers that have spoken to AppleInsider with the promise of anonymity have said they're already working on new devices with hidden MagSafe chargers. MagSafe didn't gain any new features with the iPhone 14 series but at least accessories will be getting a whole new look. Third-party MagSafe accessories are about to look a lot nicer Third-party MagSafe chargers are about to become much more varied, as Apple is now offering an updated MagSafe module to manufacturers that isn't the bright white circle that has been standard since launch.

The effects – most notably evidence of mitochondrial disruption and dysregulated choline and triglyceride levels in brain tissue – were greater in male offspring than in females. The work adds to the body of evidence that both OPFRs and BFRs can be neurotoxic. FM 550 is a flame-retardant mixture first identified a decade ago. It was developed to replace PBDEs, a class of fire retardants being phased out due to safety concerns. While some new flame retardant mixtures still contain BFRs, the OPFRs are a popular substitute for PBDEs, since it is believed that OPFRs don't accumulate in the body and thus cannot be as harmful. Specifically, it was thought that OPFRs wouldn't impact acetylcholinesterase – a key neurotransmitter. But it looks as though OPFRs still impact choline signaling and are just as bad if not worse than PBDEs for the developing brain.\" Heather Patisaul, Associate Dean for Research in NC State's College of Sciences and Corresponding Author of the Study Patisaul and her colleagues performed transcriptomic and lipidomic studies on the prefrontal cortexes of newborn rats whose mothers had been exposed to FM550, or to BFR or OPFR elements individually, during gestation. \"Getting genetic information from transcriptomics is what researchers commonly do to tease out potential connections between toxicity and health effects,\" Patisaul says. \"In this case, we also wanted to see if the lipid, or fat, composition of the brain was altered – our brains are essentially balls of fat, and lipidomics can reveal how exposure may affect the brain in its earliest developmental stages.\" Both the transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses showed evidence of mitochondrial disruption, although the disruptions were more pronounced in the offspring that had been exposed to OPFRs. Mitochondria are found in almost every cell and serve as cells' energy generators, playing a vital role in cellular respiration. The transcriptomic analysis found disruption of cellular respiration genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and ALS, while lipidomics pointed to disrupted choline and triglyceride levels in the brain. In males exposed to OPFRs, genes associated with axon guidance and choline signaling were also dysregulated. Axon guidance is the process by which neurons make the proper connections during neural development. Choline is a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which affects critical aspects of neuron function and neuronal signaling. \"That so many altered genes are involved in respiration and choline, there is concern that these FRs impair basic autonomic function and cognition,\" Patisaul says. \"So, the bottom line is that exposure to BFRs and OPFRs is disrupting both neuronal signaling and the ability of cells to properly produce and utilize energy.\" The researchers also found that male offspring were more affected than females. \"In earlier rat studies, we found that OPFR levels are higher in placentas attached to males than females,\" Patisaul says. \"So that difference in exposure could be why we see different and more severe effects in males. \"The important message here is that the presumption that OPFRs are safer that other FRs is likely wrong. Both OPFRs and BFRs can disrupt cortical development and function. And the fact that these chemicals are detectable in the placenta means they aren't breaking down quickly enough to do no damage.\" The work appears in a special issue of Neuroendocrinology , and was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Read on as we detail the first iPhone apps to support these features with iOS 16.1. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); For those unfamiliar, Live Activities is a feature available for all iPhone models running iOS 16 that shows useful app information right on the lock screen. At first, only a few Apple apps, such as Music and Clock, had Live Activities. But with iOS 16.1, developers can also integrate their apps with this feature. At the same time, apps supporting Live Activities can also show the same information on Dynamic Island for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max users. We’ve selected some of the first apps to introduce support for the Live Activities and Dynamic Island APIs. Flighty is a great iOS app that helps users keep track of all their upcoming flights through a beautiful and intuitive interface. With its latest update, Flighty can now automatically show details about your upcoming flight right on the lock screen of your iPhone three hours before departure. Flight status can also be quickly viewed on Dynamic Island by iPhone 14 Pro users. Flighty is available for free on the App Store , although some features require a subscription. The app also works with iPad and Mac. Carrot Weather is a popular iOS and macOS app that shows the weather forecast in a fun way. The new version of the app lets users check details about specific alerts, such as the possibility of rain, directly from the lock screen of their iPhone or Dynamic Island. The app is also available for free on the App Store , but some features (including access to Live Activities) require a subscription. Carrot Weather is also compatible with the iPad and Apple Watch. SmartGym is known for helping iPhone, iPad, and especially Apple Watch users track their workouts with details about weightlifting, bodyweight workouts, and more. The new update supports Live Activities to show details of a workout in progress right on the iPhone lock screen or Dynamic Island. The latest SmartGym update also optimizes the app to work with Apple Watch Ultra and the new Action Button. SmartGym is a free download for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac from the App Store with in-app purchases for the Premium plan to unlock all of the app’s features. Aviary is a third-party Twitter client for iOS, macOS, and even watchOS. Recently, the app has been completely rebuilt with a more modern interface. Now the app has been updated with support for edited tweets as well as a Live Activity and a button on Dynamic Island to “Undo Tweet.” If you wrote something wrong or regret that tweet, you can quickly cancel it. Aviary is available on the App Store for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. The app is free to download, but it requires a paid subscription. Soor is one of many apps that extend the functionality of Apple Music for iPhone and iPad users. It works as a complete replacement for the native Music app on iOS. The new version of Soor now lets users see song lyrics in real time with Live Activities and Dynamic Island. The app is available on the App Store as a one-time purchase of $6.99, which unlocks the full experience on both iPhone and iPad. TV Remote is a simple but useful iOS app that lets users control their Smart TVs directly from an iPhone or iPad. Earlier this year, the app was updated with theme options, custom layout, and widgets. Now TV Remote also works with Live Activities, so it shows quick access to some remote control buttons right from the iPhone lock screen or Dynamic Island. TV Remote 2 is now available for free on the App Store . However, in order to unlock some of the features such as themes and widgets, users must subscribe to TV Remote Premium. Pestle lets users import recipes from any website, and the app turns them into a step-by-step process automatically. The app will then scan the recipe for ingredients, steps, nutritional information, and more. With its latest update, Pestle shows the current step of a recipe with a timer right from the lock screen or Dynamic Island for those with an iPhone 14 Pro. You can download Pestle for free on the App Store , although some features are only available through in-app purchases.

Being the best marksman we’ve ever witnessed shoot the ball, the Golden State Warriors leader has managed to revolutionize the NBA. Since stepping foot onto the hardwood in 2009, The Baby-Faced Assassin used his accurate shooting as an unfair advantage over his opponents and managed to rack up a pretty illustrious resume. A staked trophy cabinet of Chef Curry’s is highlighted with his 2 MVPs, 4 championships, and 1 Finals MVP, among a long list of other impressive accolades. Over the past few years, especially after GSW’s first championship run, we saw Steph hit turnaround three-pointers. However, back in 2013, when the sharpshooter wasn’t the established superstar he is today, the shifty guard bring out the famous move. Curry was absolutely sensational during GSW’s first-round clash against the Nuggets back in the 2013 Playoffs. In the 6 games, the scrawny 6-foot-3 PG went on to record 24.3/4.3/9.3 on an extremely efficient 46.8/44.2/100 shooting split. However, there was one specific play during the series, that left the entire Denver squad in awe of a younger Curry’s greatness. According to Andre Iguodala, it was SC30’s turnaround three-pointer, which he has popularized recently, that left the Nuggets bench stunned. In an appearance on “ ”, Iggy detailed: The play Andre is talking about occurred midway into the 3rd quarter of Game 1. Here, have a look at the clip. Here’s the play, for those wondering. Game 4, 1st round, 2013 playoffs. — Tommy Gunn (@tgunn21) Yes, when Curry entered the 2009 Draft, he was undeniably the best shooter of the class. However, no one could have possibly imagined that the former Davidson Wildcat would end up becoming the three-point GOAT.

For a recently published paper, the researchers reviewed the scientific literature on the effects of fire on forest composition and structure and its influence on ticks and their wildlife hosts. They concluded that prescribed burning can help restore forest habitats to a state less favorable to several species of disease-carrying ticks and could be an effective management tactic for reducing their populations. The era of fire suppression, which began roughly in the early 1900s and has continued for more than a century, changed the species composition of Eastern forests, creating habitats and microclimates that favored the survival and spread of ticks, noted lead author Michael Gallagher, research ecologist at the Silas Little Experimental Forest, Northern Research Station, U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, New Lisbon, New Jersey. \"Before the arrival of Europeans, Eastern forests were 'fire-dependent,' characterized by fire-tolerant species such as pine, oak and chestnut,\" Gallagher said. \"Frequent low-to-moderate intensity fires would have fostered dry conditions, thinned the understory and diminished layers of leaf litter, which in turn would have created microclimates with lower humidity and higher temperatures. \"These lower-moisture, higher-temperature -; or xeric -; conditions were likely to limit ticks' activity, interaction with reservoir hosts and overall populations,\" he said. Since fire has been suppressed and forests have recovered significantly from periods of deforestation caused by logging and agricultural land-clearing, fire-sensitive mesic forest species -; those that thrive in and contribute to moister environments -; have become dominant, a process known as mesophication, he explained. This mesophication of forests has been widely observed throughout the eastern United States. In the absence of fire, these mesic habitats moderate forest temperatures and humidity, promote denser understory growth, and cause greater moisture retention in forest litter. This creates microclimates within the ideal range for tick survival and optimizes conditions for ticks to 'quest,' or seek hosts.\" Michael Gallagher, Lead Author The number of tick-borne disease cases in the United States has trended higher in recent decades, ranging to as high as nearly 60,000 annually and accounting for more than 75% of vector-borne disease cases, according to the researchers, who published their analysis in Ecological Applications . Tick-borne pathogens can cause Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Powassan disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia and other illnesses. \"Research suggests that conditions contributing to this rise in cases resulted from climate change, growth of certain wildlife populations, land-use change and, likely, forest change due to the decline of fire frequency,\" said co-author Erika Machtinger, assistant professor of entomology in Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences. \"These changes have created conditions known to drive tick abundance, tick-wildlife host interactions and expansion of ticks' geographic range.\" In addition to fire's direct effect on tick survival by subjecting them to heat high enough to cause mortality, several indirect effects of fire-driven forest modification can suppress tick abundance and pathogen transmission, she said. \"Reductions in canopy and understory density and the creation of gap space from prescribed burning can increase sun exposure and wind speed and reduce evapotranspiration from plants, promoting hotter and drier conditions during the daytime and colder temperatures at night,\" said Machtinger, who directs the college's Veterinary Entomology Laboratory. \"These more frequent moisture and temperature extremes can exceed tick tolerances and affect behavior, development time, molting and overall survival.\" She also pointed out that thinner layers of leaf litter due to burning could reduce insulation and lower the temperature of soils where ticks overwinter, causing higher mortality. In addition, studies indicate that fire-driven habitat change is likely to increase the population of certain wildlife predators of ticks, such as red imported fire ants and bobwhite quail. \"On the other hand, reduced woody plant density and debris as a result of fire actually may decrease populations of some small mammal hosts of ticks by removing cover and making them more vulnerable to predation,\" Machtinger said. \"This would reduce ticks' interaction with hosts that serve as reservoirs of disease pathogens.\" The researchers noted that the current paradigm for tick-borne disease control places nearly all the burden on the individual to prevent tick bites, while broader-scale tick management by professionals has been insufficient to stem increases in tick-borne pathogen transmission. \"Although the fire suppression era persists in many parts of the United States, prescribed burns have been used successfully in a growing number of fire-suppressed landscapes in recent decades,\" Gallagher said. \"We believe there's an opportunity to reduce the number of ticks by using prescribed fire to restore the health of forest ecosystems, and we think this approach can be integrated as part of a multipronged strategy for managing ticks and tick-borne diseases.\" Other co-authors of the paper are Jesse Kreye, assistant professor of fire and natural resources management, and Nathaniel Schmidt, former master's degree student, Penn State; Alexis Everland, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Forest Fire Service, New Lisbon, New Jersey; and Nicholas Skowronski, USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Morgantown, West Virginia.

The allegations further claim that between May 2020 and February 2022 particularly, Fitbit made representations to Aussie consumers that they wouldn’t be entitled to any refund for a faulty product if seeking to make a return after 45 days from the date of purchase or shipment. This is the second time Fitbit has been slammed by the ACCC, following very similar allegations made against the wearable manufacturer in 2018 (opens in new tab) . “Fitbit has again come to the ACCC’s attention for allegedly misleading consumers about their consumer guarantee rights,” said ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb in a statement, “We are taking this case against Fitbit because we consider the alleged conduct is serious and that manufacturers should have processes in place that ensure compliance with the Australian Consumer Law.” When sought for comment, a Fitbit spokesperson told TechRadar Australia, “Fitbit will be reviewing the ACCC’s allegations and does not have further comments to share at this time.” Google could not be reached for comment at time of publication. Under Australian consumer law, a customer’s rights in respect to a faulty product are not limited by any time periods, either from date of purchase or otherwise. The law further enforces that businesses and manufacturers who sell a product with a major problem, or which develops a major problem, must provide Aussie consumers with either a refund or offer of replacement. A deduction from a refund made based on how long a consumer has had a product before it develops a major problem is also not permitted under Australian consumer law. Fitbit’s new stoush with the Aussie watchdog adds to a rough few months for the fitness tracker giant, having been faced with troubling issues plaguing its existing products while continuing to lose ground in the wearables market to the Apple Watch and seeing fellow competitor Samsung gaining considerable momentum with its Galaxy Watch offerings. Meanwhile, Google’s other entry into the wearables space – the Google Pixel Watch – has faced some issues of its own despite an initially warm reception upon its release. Given the importance of fitness tracking to wearables, and Google’s ownership of the pioneers in the fitness tracking space (aka Fitbit), reports of persistent issues (opens in new tab) with the Pixel Watch’s tracking of calories burned would be cause for concern to the tech giant. Poor battery life has also been a constant complaint since the Pixel Watch’s release, an issue similarly faced by primary competitor the Apple Watch when compared to wearables with less functions such as those in the Fitbit range. Likewise, user reception pointing out how poorly the Pixel Watch manages to differentiate itself from competitors or demonstrate any advantage has led to considerable disappointment given the hype ahead of the watch’s release. While the aforementioned issues don’t come under consumer law protections, this legal battle could be cause for concern and hopefully a prod for Google to improve its entries in the wearables market, with Fitbit’s ability to comply with consumer laws likely one such area now high on the agenda. The ACCC is seeking penalties, injunctions, a compliance program and other orders against Fitbit, with adjustments expected to be made for future proceedings given that Fitbit is based in the United States.\ntechradar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/fitbit-set-for-legal-faceoff-with-australian-watchdog-over-refund-and-repla/","tags":[],"title":"Fitbit set for legal faceoff with Australian watchdog over refund and replacement policy"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"Researchers study the effects of alcohol intake and seek better treatment for alcoholic pancreatitis Many alcoholic pancreatitis patients continued drinking during COVID-19. University of Miami Miller School of Medicine researchers study the effects of continued alcohol intake and seek better treatment for alcohol-associated pancreatic disease.\nMany alcoholic pancreatitis patients continued drinking during COVID-19. University of Miami Miller School of Medicine researchers study the effects of continued alcohol intake and seek better treatment for alcohol-associated pancreatic disease. Researchers at the Miller School are looking for solutions to the continued effects of alcohol use, its harmful impact, and treatment. Understanding the mechanisms of alcohol abuse has gained importance, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher alcohol consumption led to an increased burden of pancreatic diseases in society. In a study titled \"Urolithin A attenuates severity of chronic pancreatitis associated with continued alcohol intake by inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling,\" published in the American Journal of Physiology – Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology , researchers examine the short- and long-term consequences of this increased alcohol effect on pancreatic diseases and work together on innovative approaches to better understand how to treat pancreatitis patients with continued alcohol intake. Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas often associated with long-term alcohol consumption, a potential risk factor for the induction of acute pancreatitis. Recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis results in chronic pancreatitis. Each year, about 275,000 hospital stays for acute pancreatitis and 86,000 hospital stays for chronic pancreatitis occur across the U.S., according to the statistics released by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Acute pancreatitis appears suddenly and can typically be resolved in days with treatment in most patients. However, acute pancreatitis can also cause severe life-threatening conditions in some cases. Recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis instigate irreversible damage to the pancreas, causing weight loss, pain, diabetes, and even pancreatic cancer. Total alcohol sales almost tripled in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic, subsequently increasing the number of patients diagnosed with alcohol-associated pancreatitis. Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with 40-70% of pancreatitis cases. Without moderation, alcohol use harshly impacts both the liver and pancreas, causing fat accumulation and inflammation, disrupting normal function. With repeated episodes of binge drinking (four to five drinks in two hours), the pancreas eventually builds up scar tissues with persistent inflammation, weakening its endocrine and exocrine functions needed to digest food and regulate blood sugar levels. This chronic insult to the organ can cause excruciating pain, malnutrition, diabetes, and death. We are developing novel models to study and to prevent inflammation or reverse the pancreatic damage caused due to excess alcohol intake.\" Nagaraj Nagathihalli, Ph.D., Lead Author, Associate Professor of Surgery, DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology Accumulating scientific evidence suggests that continued alcohol consumption with established alcoholic pancreatitis instigates irreversible pancreatic damage due to recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis by fostering a continuous fibro-inflammatory microenvironment within the pancreas. \"The molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of alcoholic pancreatitis with continuous alcohol intake remains ambiguous; treatment options and preventative care strategies are restricted due to limited experimental animal models that successfully recapitulate human pancreatitis arising from prolonged or continued alcohol use after established pancreatic injury,\" said Dr. Nagathihalli. \"In this study, using an established alcoholic pancreatitis mice model, we have addressed two of the major unanswered questions with regards to the pathogenesis of pancreatitis. We've characterized the pancreas-specific signaling pathways in this process and determined if utilizing novel therapeutic agents can attenuate the severity of alcoholic pancreatitis progression, despite continued alcohol triggers\" said first author of the study Siddharth Mehra, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the Miller School's Department of Surgery. The microbiome has been implicated in gastrointestinal inflammation as a critical mediator of overall gut health. Urolithin A is a natural compound synthesized by gut bacteria from ingested ellagitannins, a class of hydrolyzable tannins found mainly in pomegranate, berries, and nuts. Previous work from the group has shown that Urolithin A is a potent anti-inflammatory agent in several pre-clinical disease models and exhibits anti-tumor activity in gastrointestinal cancers. \"Our studies have demonstrated that Urolithin A is well tolerated and does not elicit any adverse toxic effects at clinically relevant doses in mice. However, despite the promising effect of Urolithin A in several malignancies and inflammatory disorders, the benefit of this microbial metabolite in the prevention of pancreatitis had not been investigated,\" says Dr. Nagathihalli. The FDA recognizes Urolithin A as a \"safe dietary supplement.\" \"In animal experiments, we have shown that Urolithin A can help improve the effectiveness of treating alcoholic pancreatitis despite continued alcohol intake,\" said Dr. Mehra.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, heart attacks were the leading cause of death worldwide but were steadily on the decline. However, the new study-;recently published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Medical Virology -; shows that heart attack death rates took a sharp turn and increased for all age groups during the pandemic. The spikes in heart attack deaths have tracked with surges of COVID-19 infection-;even during the presumed less-severe Omicron phase of the pandemic. Furthermore, the data showed the increase was most significant among individuals ages 25-44, who are not usually considered at high risk for heart attack. The dramatic rise in heart attacks during the pandemic has reversed what was a prior decadelong steady improvement in cardiac deaths. We are still learning the many ways by which COVID-19 affects the body, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or race.\" Yee Hui Yeo, MD, Study's First Author and Cedars-Sinai Physician-Scientist Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Vital Statistics System, the Cedars-Sinai researchers identified 1,522,699 deaths from heart attacks-;medically called acute myocardial infarctions-;between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2022. Investigators then compared age-related mortality rates between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, as well as demographic groups and regions. Key findings from the study include: \"There are several potential explanations for the rapid rise in cardiac deaths in patients with COVID-19, yet still many unanswered questions,\" said Yeo. \"Importantly, our results highlight disparities in mortality that have emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic and that are persisting even through the Omicron era.\" The possible explanations, Yeo said, include that COVID-19 may trigger or accelerate the presentation of preexisting coronary artery disease, even in younger adults. Reasons for the spike in heart-related conditions could also be related to psychological and social challenges associated with the pandemic, including job loss and other financial pressures that can cause acute or chronic stress leading to cardiac disease. The research team members say they have long known that infections such as the flu can increase risk for heart disease and heart attack, but the sharp rise in heart attack deaths is like nothing seen before. \"There is something very different about how this virus affects the cardiac risks,\" said Susan Cheng, MD, MPH, director of the Institute for Research on Healthy Aging in the Department of Cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute and senior and co-corresponding author of the study. \"The difference is likely due to a combination of stress and inflammation, arising from predisposing factors and the way this virus biologically interacts with the cardiovascular system.\" Yeo, Cheng and the broader Smidt Heart Institute team hope that greater awareness and more research will expand the medical community's ability to manage and mitigate these risks.

Despite its prevalence and severity, however, the condition is difficult to diagnose and treat effectively. The disease can cause decreased blood flow to vital organs, inflammation throughout the body, and abnormal blood clotting. Therefore, if sepsis isn't recognized and treated quickly, it can lead to shock, organ failure, and death. But it can be difficult to identify which pathogen is causing sepsis, or whether an infection is in the bloodstream or elsewhere in the body. And in many patients with symptoms that resemble sepsis, it can be challenging to determine whether they truly have an infection at all. Now, researchers at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub (CZ Biohub), the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), and UC San Francisco (UCSF) have developed a new diagnostic method that applies machine learning to advanced genomics data from both microbe and host – to identify and predict sepsis cases. As reported on October 20, 2022 in Nature Microbiology , the approach is surprisingly accurate, and has the potential to far exceed current diagnostic capabilities. Sepsis is one of the top 10 public health issues facing humanity. One of the key challenges with sepsis is diagnosis. Existing diagnostic tests are not able to capture the dual-sided nature of the disease – the infection itself and the host's immune response to the infection.\" Chaz Langelier, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Author, Associate Professor of Medicine, UCSF's Division of Infectious Diseases and a CZ Biohub Investigator Current sepsis diagnostics focus on detecting bacteria by growing them in culture, a process that is \"essential for appropriate antibiotic therapy, which is critical for sepsis survival,\" according to the researchers behind the new method. But culturing these pathogens is time-consuming and doesn't always correctly identify the bacterium that is causing the infection. Similarly for viruses, PCR tests can detect that viruses are infecting a patient but don't always identify the particular virus that's causing sepsis. \"This results in clinicians being unable to identify the cause of sepsis in an estimated 30 to 50% of cases,\" Langelier said. \"This also leads to a mismatch in terms of the antibiotic treatment and the pathogen causing the problem.\" In the absence of a definitive diagnosis, doctors often prescribe a cocktail of antibiotics in an effort to stop the infection, but the overuse of antibiotics has led to increased antibiotic resistance worldwide. \"As physicians, we never want to miss a case of infection,\" said Carolyn Calfee, M.D., M.A.S., a professor of medicine and anesthesia at UCSF and co–senior author of the new study. \"But if we had a test that could help us accurately determine who doesn't have an infection, then that could help us limit antibiotic use in those cases, which would be really good for all of us.\" The researchers analyzed whole blood and plasma samples from more than 350 critically ill patients who had been admitted to UCSF Medical Center or the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital between 2010 and 2018. But rather than relying on cultures to identify pathogens in these samples, a team led by CZ Biohub scientists Norma Neff, Ph.D., and Angela Pisco, Ph.D., instead used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). This method identifies all the nucleic acids or genetic data present in a sample, then compares those data to reference genomes to identify the microbial organisms present. This technique allows scientists to identify genetic material from entirely different kingdoms of organisms – whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi – that are present in the same sample. However, detecting and identifying the presence of a pathogen alone isn't enough for accurate sepsis diagnosis, so the Biohub researchers also performed transcriptional profiling – which quantifies gene expression – to capture the patient's response to infection. Next they applied machine learning to the mNGS and transcriptional data to distinguish between sepsis and other critical illnesses and thus confirm the diagnosis. Katrina Kalantar, Ph.D., a lead computational biologist at CZI and co–first author of the study, created an integrated host–microbe model trained on data from patients in whom either sepsis or non-infectious systemic inflammatory illnesses had been established, which enabled sepsis diagnosis with very high accuracy. \"We developed the model by looking at a bunch of metagenomics data alongside results from traditional clinical tests,\" Kalantar explained. To start, the researchers identified changes in gene expression between patients with confirmed sepsis and non-infectious systemic inflammatory conditions that appear clinically similar, then used machine learning to identify the genes that could best predict those changes. The researchers found that when traditional bacterial culture identified a sepsis-causing pathogen, there was usually an overabundance of genetic material from that pathogen in the corresponding plasma sample analyzed by mNGS. With that in mind, Kalantar programmed the model to identify organisms present in disproportionately high abundance compared to other microbes in the sample, and to then compare those to a reference index of well-known sepsis-causing microbes. \"In addition to that, we also noted any viruses that were detected, even if they were at lower levels, because those really shouldn't be there,\" Kalantar explained. \"With this relatively straightforward set of rules, we were able to do pretty well.\" The researchers found that the mNGS method and their corresponding model worked better than expected: They were able to identify 99% of confirmed bacterial sepsis cases, 92% of confirmed viral sepsis cases, and were able to predict sepsis in 74% of clinically suspected cases that hadn't been definitively diagnosed. \"We were expecting good performance, or even great performance, but this was almost perfect,\" said Lucile Neyton, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Calfee lab and co–first author of the study. \"By using this approach, we get a pretty good idea of what is causing the disease, and we know with relatively high confidence if a patient has sepsis or not.\" The team was also excited to discover that they could use this combined host-response and microbe detection method to diagnose sepsis using plasma samples, which are routinely collected from most patients as part of standard clinical care. \"The fact that you can actually identify sepsis patients from this widely available, easy-to-collect sample type has big implications in terms of practical utility,\" Langelier said. The idea for the work stemmed from previous research by Langelier, Kalantar, Calfee, UCSF researcher and CZ Biohub President Joe DeRisi, Ph.D., and their colleagues, in which they used mNGS to effectively diagnose lower respiratory tract infections in critically ill patients. Because the method worked so well, \"we wanted to see if the same type of approach could work in the context of sepsis,\" said Kalantar. The team hopes to build upon this successful diagnostic technique by developing a model that can also predict antibiotic resistance from pathogens detected with this method. \"We've had some success doing that for respiratory infections, but no one has come up with a good approach for sepsis,\" Langelier said. Furthermore, the researchers hope to eventually be able to predict outcomes of patients with sepsis, \"such as mortality or length of stay in the hospital, which would provide key information that would allow clinicians to better care for their patients and match resources to the patients who need them the most,\" Langelier said. \"There's a lot of potential for novel sequencing approaches such as this to help us more precisely identify the causes of a patient's critical illness,\" added Calfee. \"If we can do that, it's the first step towards precision medicine and understanding what's going on at an individual patient level.\" Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Kalantar, K.L., et al.

The European Union (EU) is in the midst of working through a multi-pronged solution to ameliorate the negative effects of the present situation, which in the short term was a direct result of international sanctions on Russian energy following the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February this year. In the longer term, the long-running over-reliance on cheap Russian gas on the part of many EU states, including its de facto leader, Germany, is the key reason for the current disastrous energy crunch across the region. One key element of this multi-pronged EU plan is the imposition of a price cap on gas prices. However, three developments last week from Russia, Qatar, and China threaten to undermine the EU’s efforts to bring some stability to its gas market over the winter period, and to reduce the energy risk premium being priced into their economic outlooks and the pricing of their financial asset markets. The first of these is that Russia’s state-owned gas behemoth, Gazprom, has threatened to halt all of its gas supplies to the EU if a price cap on gas is introduced. Broadly speaking, gas imports from Russia made up around 40 percent of the EU’s gas supply in 2021, with the more specific details analysed by OilPrice.com recently, but have dropped to around 9 percent in recent weeks. According to Gazprom’s chief executive officer, Alexei Miller, last week, any such gas price cap would be a breach of contract on the part of EU buyers of Gazprom’s gas that would result in a suspension of gas supplies from the company. Although Russian gas deliveries to the EU via its Nord Stream and Yamal-Europe pipelines have been subject to repeated disruption since the invasion of Ukraine, and both routes are still currently closed off to Europe, Russian gas is still being delivered to selected European buyers through the Sudzha entry point on the border with Ukraine and the TurkStream pipeline. Related: Oil Tanker Market In Disarray As EU Ban On Russian Crude Nears On 18 October, the EU’s executive arm, the European Commission (EC), proposed further emergency measures to reduce the high energy prices that have caused a spike in inflation across the region and beyond, and a sharp rise in interest rates to combat it, with the economy- crimping effects that these can cause. Although steering clear of an outright cap on gas prices at that point, the EC did ask for the EU member states’ approval to draft a proposal to set a temporary ‘maximum dynamic price’ on trades at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) Dutch gas hub, which serves as a benchmark price for European gas trading. Other measures discussed at the meeting included energy regulators being tasked with launching an alternative benchmark price for liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 31 March 2023, and the launching a joint gas buying program among EU countries, in an effort to refill depleted storage caverns in time for next winter, and to allow for the negotiation of lower gas prices in the future. However, in a subsequent EU meeting that began on 20 October, German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, dropped his opposition to the imposition of an EU gas price cap, and EU leaders then agreed to work towards a cap that would “immediately limit episodes of excessive gas prices.” EC President, Charles Michel, underlined that the EU’s leaders had reached an agreement that would bring down prices, and added: “I think that we sent a clear signal to the markets that we are ready to act together, that we are able to act together.” According to the official minutes of this latest meeting, the EU’s leaders formally request that the EC works “urgently…on a temporary dynamic price corridor on natural gas transactions.” The previously floated idea of a mechanism to limit the price of gas used for electricity generation is also present in the minutes, as is the notion that member states pursue joint purchasing of gas, the development of a new benchmark for gas prices, and the increasing of efforts to reduce gas demand. Related: Colombia Is On The Brink Of An Energy Crisis All of which likely means that Russia will indeed cut off all supplies of gas to Europe at some point in the very near future for as long as it wishes, which, in turn, means that the EU will need to find other sources of substitute supply to bridge any supply transition gaps in the short-, medium-, and long-term. Qatar had been top of the list of such alternative supply sources, as highlighted by OilPrice.com, but, in the second setback for the EU’s energy security plans, it said last week that it will not divert any gas that is already under contract with Asian buyers to Europe this winter, regardless of any other considerations. Saad al-Kaabi, the chief executive of state-owned QatarEnergy, and also Energy Minister, said: “Qatar is absolutely committed to [the] sanctity of contracts... When we sign with an Asian buyer or European buyers, we stick to that agreement.” This statement of policy is a blow to hopes held by the EU in general, and by Germany in particular, that the emirate could be persuaded to do precisely the opposite of its stated intention, and divert supplies that had been destined for Asia to Europe instead, breaking contracts if necessary, for a hefty premium if required. Just last month, Qatar’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said that his country was in talks with several German companies about new liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies and sources spoken to last week by OilPrice.com confirmed that included among them are utilities giants, RWE and Uniper. The specific deals followed on from two major initiatives implemented by Germany in the wake of the sanctions on Russia. The first is focused on enhancing gas delivery mechanisms into Europe, with a declaration of intent on energy cooperation signed in May between Germany and Qatar aimed at ramping up LNG supplies going into Germany through existing importation routes augmented by new infrastructure. This includes the deployment of four floating LNG import facilities on its northern coast, and two permanent onshore terminals, which are under development, according to sources within the EU’s energy security apparatus exclusively spoken to by OilPrice.com. These plans, said one of the sources, will run in parallel with plans for Qatar to also make available to Germany sizeable supplies of LNG from the Golden Pass terminal on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in which QatarEnergy holds a 70 percent stake, with ExxonMobil holding the remainder. However, the sources added, the delivery timelines and volumes under discussion would offer only a partial solution to the gas crunch Europe faces and even this will not occur any time soon. This said, both Germany and France have been busy seeking further alternatives, although how reliable in the energy or political sense of the word they will be remains to be seen. According to local UAE sources , following the visits of Scholz and Germany’s Economy Minister, Robert Habeck, as part of a new Energy Security and Industry Accelerator agreement signed between the UAE and Germany, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) will supply RWE with an LNG cargo in late 2022 to be used in the country’s floating LNG import terminal in Brunsbuttel. ADNOC has also earmarked several other LNG cargoes for German customers for delivery in 2023, the same sources said. France’s TotalEnergies, meanwhile, recently signed a partnership agreement with ADNOC that includes cooperation in trading, product supply and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. As TotalEnergies stated at the time of the signing of the partnership agreement with ADNOC: “[The agreement includes] the development of oil and gas projects in the UAE to ensure sustainable energy supply to the markets and contribute to global energy security.” The final of the three potential setbacks for the EU’s new multi-pronged energy initiative, although itself entirely predictable, given the zero-sum game of energy, economics, and geopolitical dominance currently being played out between the West and the East, is that China will not help Europe out at all. According to several reports last week , China has told its state-owned gas importers to stop reselling LNG to buyers in Europe (and in Asia) as it seeks to ensure its own supply for the winter season. As highlighted for some time by OilPrice.com, China has been busily securing long-term contracts for LNG supplies for months – well before Russia invaded Ukraine – with a key target seller being, of course, Qatar . This remarkably coincidental level of prescience – almost impossible to believe, in fact - means that not only has China tied up much of the gas supplies that Europe has found itself needing but also that it has done so at the rock-bottom gas prices that pre-dated the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The findings, published in the October 20, 2022 issue of Nature Communications , show that the same molecules involved in RA can have opposite functions in cells obtained from different patients -; and help explain why current targeted therapies evoke different responses in patients with the same diagnosis and similar symptoms. Arthritis encompasses more than 100 conditions that affect the joints, tissues around the joint and other connective tissues. It is estimated that more than 58 million adults in the United States (one in five) have been diagnosed with the condition. Osteoarthritis is the most common form, involving degeneration of joints, often in the hands, hips, and knees. RA is less common, but still affects more than two million Americans, primarily women. It is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by long lasting or chronic, painful tissue inflammation in affected joints. It can also cause problems in other organs, such as the lungs, heart, and eyes. The causes and risk factors for RA are myriad and not well understood. They range from age, sex, and lifestyle (such as smoking) to obesity and inherited traits. There is no cure for RA, but there are a broad range of targeted treatments that can help slow disease progression, prevent joint deformity, and reduce pain and disability. Although that RA arises with similar clinical appearance between patients, response to any individual treatment is unpredictable and requires a trial and error method. This process is repeated until a drug that decreases disease activity for that particular patient is identified.\" Gary Firestein, MD, Co-Corresponding Author, Distinguished Professor of Medicine and Director of the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute, UC San Diego School of Medicine \"Many patients have improved outcomes, but a significant percentage do not. They have persistent inflammation. These variable responses to therapy indicate the same disease can have diverse mechanisms.\" That diversity or heterogeneity of disease with varying cell types in individual RA patients has driven efforts to find personalized mechanisms that would help to better understand the nature of RA and reliably prescribe effective, early treatment. In the new study, the UC San Diego team focused on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), a specialized cell type found inside joint synovium -; a soft connective tissue that lubricates joints and minimizes wear-and-tear. FLS play a major role in RA joint destruction. Examining cultured primary FLS, the researchers identified specific transcription factors (proteins that regulate the transcription or copying of genes) that are involved in individual RA patients' cell lines. The analysis allowed scientists to stratify those cell lines into at least two subtypes with different predicted activated pathways that could contribute to inflammation. \"Essentially, we biologically validated these predictions for the top subtype-specific transcription factors,\" said co-corresponding author Wei Wang, PhD, professor in the departments of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. \"This study is the first to characterize groups of cell lines from RA patients with distinctive transcription factor biology by integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic data.\" System biology is a computational approach that studies the interactions and behavior of all components of a biological entity, based on the understanding that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. In taking this approach, the authors wrote, the findings could help pave the way toward a greater understanding of RA's heterogeneity while providing better focus on existing and future therapies personalized to individual patients.

Sunak had told TOI he was \"strongly committed\" to the UK-India FTA to create jobs in both countries and for India to liberalise its consumer financial services industry. The UK-India trade deal stalled under Liz Truss after disparaging remarks by then home secretary Suella Braverman regarding migration from India to the UK. But UK-India relations could soar under Sunak. It did not take long for PM Narendra Modi to tweet: \"Warmest congratulations @RishiSunak! As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues, and implementing Roadmap 2030. Special Diwali wishes to the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership.\" Sunak previously told TOI in an exclusive interview that he was \"strongly committed\" to the UK-India FTA and that the City of London could help facilitate India's growth by helping to get capital to them and also that the UK could facilitate climate finance to fund India's net zero ambitions. He also told TOI he was keen for the FTA to create jobs in both countries and for India to liberalise its consumer financial services industry. \"There is a rapidly growing consumer financial services industry in India, for example in insurance, and where India is opening up markets, financial services companies like HSBC and others, are able to offer products, services to Indian consumers, often in partnership with Indians firms, and that is good, as it broadens choice for Indian citizens.\" he said. Earlier this year too he said the way he reimagined the UK-India relationship was \"a partnership of equals\" where the brightest talent from both countries travel back and forth to study and work, one which includes a close trading partnership on goods and services, and where the UK and India freely exchange world-class ideas and innovation. In a speech at the India Global Forum UK-India awards earlier this year, he said: \"The UK does not have a natural right to sit at the table with one of the world's largest, fastest growing, and most dynamic economies. We must earn it. Right now, there are something like 900 million Indian people under the age of 35. They are smart. They are increasingly well-educated. They are ambitious. And when they look out at the world, we can't take for granted that they will look to the UK.\"\ntoi\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/hope-floats-for-stalled-india-uk-trade-deal/","tags":[],"title":"Hope floats for stalled India-UK trade deal"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"“Has it all and is different from the others” – Gary Lineker chooses ‘exceptional’ Barcelona star as his favorite above Lionel Messi sportskeeda\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/has-it-all-and-is-different-from-the-others-gary-lineker-chooses-/","tags":["Football"],"title":"“Has it all and is different from the others” – Gary Lineker chooses ‘exceptional’ Barcelona star as his favorite above Lionel Messi"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"T20 World Cup 2022 Points Table: Updated standings after South Africa vs Zimbabwe Match 18 sportskeeda\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/t20-world-cup-2022-points-table-updated-standings-after-south-africa-vs-zi/","tags":["Cricket News"],"title":"T20 World Cup 2022 Points Table: Updated standings after South Africa vs Zimbabwe Match 18"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Early Black Friday Samsung TV deals: save up to $3,000 on The Frame, Neo 4K, 8K, OLED TVs Samsung has launched Black Friday savings on its TV line, with discounts of up to $3,000 off Neo QLED 4K and 8K panels, as well as The Frame and OLED sets.Save up to $3,000 on Samsung TVs.Samsung's Black Friday in October sale offers highly aggressive deals on its TV range — making it an excellent time to upgrade your home theater and pair the high-definition models with Apple's new 2022 Apple TV 4K with 128GB of storage (check prices).

When it comes to the NBA, guys like Julius Erving and even Magic Johnson were people who he looked up to. Watching Dr. J take to NBA hardwood in person for the first time was actually what led to O’Neal telling his father that he wanted to be a professional basketball player. However, the two men only taught him about what kind of basketball player he wanted to be. In terms of life lessons, there was only one person in Shaq’s life, his stepfather, Phillip Harrison. Shaq and his stepfather were so close that he never even considered Harrison to be his stepfather, always calling him his father throughout his life. Diesel learned a lot of things from Phillip Harrison. This included responsibility, chivalry, and even kindness. Also Read: Throughout his life, Shaq has had numerous life-changing experiences. Most of them have changed his life for the better and have been brought on through his interactions with his stepfather, Phillip Harrison. In an interview talking about his relationship with his stepfather. The four-time NBA Champion revealed how he learned a valuable lesson of kindness from him. Diesel recalled how he and his stepfather once went for a meal to White Castle. On their way back, Shaq was told to stop the car and he witnessed his stepdad help a hungry homeless man. Harrison gave the man some of the leftovers they had from their trip to White Castle. Leaving O’Neal with a lesson he would never forget. In 1992, O’Neal entered the NBA, and throughout his 19-year career, he accumulated a lot of wealth. Enough to put his parents on a $750,000 salary. A truly grateful gesture on Shaq’s part. It is amazing just how thoughtful and caring a human being the big man is, his stepfather would be proud.

New IRS Instructions for Tax Form 1040 The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released its 2022 draft instructions for tax form 1040 last week. Form 1040 is the tax form used for filing individual income tax returns in the U.S. The new instructions contain several changes relating to cryptocurrency. The section titled “Virtual Currency” has been replaced with one titled “Digital Assets.” The IRS detailed: Digital assets are any digital representations of value that are recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology. For example, digital assets include non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. In contrast, NFTs and stablecoins were not mentioned in the 2021 instructions for tax form 1040. The instructions explain that taxpayers must check the “Yes” box next to the question on digital assets on page 1 of the tax form 1040 if at any time during 2022, they “received (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services)” or “sold, exchanged, gifted, or otherwise disposed of a digital asset (or any financial interest in any digital asset).” The 1040 draft tax form for the year 2022 was released in August. Matt Metras, an enrolled agent and cryptocurrency tax specialist at MDM Financial Services in Rochester, New York, was quoted by CNBC as saying Monday: I think that’s a good change. People who trade things like NFTs would not think of that as a virtual currency. He added that the IRS’ “broader language” may include new categories, such as taxpayers receiving digital assets from “play-to-earn games.” Metras noted: “The IRS is always going to be behind the eight ball because they just can’t keep up with how fast the crypto space is changing.” Miles Fuller, head of government solutions at Taxbit and former senior counsel with the Office of Chief Counsel at the IRS, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying: The IRS is ramping up by coalescing their terminology around this digital asset term. “So it means that it’s more likely than not in the near future, we’re gonna see those regs come out and the IRS continuing to move forward with sort of implementation of a regulatory regime,” he opined. “Probably sooner rather than later.” What do you think about the IRS’ revised crypto-related instructions?

The answers are important when it comes to dealing with antibiotic resistance, which is a serious challenge for the entire healthcare sector.\nDo many Swedes obtain antibiotics without a prescription, and what drives their behaviour when this happens? The answers are important when it comes to dealing with antibiotic resistance, which is a serious challenge for the entire healthcare sector. Practical philosophers and political scientists at the University of Gothenburg have carried out a large study examining Swedes' experiences of - and attitudes towards - obtaining antibiotics without a prescription. The researchers are affiliated with the Centre for Antibiotic Resistance Research (CARe) at the University of Gothenburg, and their study has recently been published in the scientific journal PLOS One. In order to slow down the development of resistant bacteria it is key to limit the use of antibiotics. This is why healthcare services are trying to limit prescriptions for antibiotics, with doctors being encouraged to take a restrictive approach. At the same time, there are many opportunities to get hold of antibiotics without a prescription, such as when traveling abroad, via foreign contacts or from online pharmacies that circumvent national regulations. \"First we conducted a smaller pilot study,\" says Christian Munthe, who led the study in collaboration with Erik Malmqvist and Björn Rönnerstrand. \"Eighteen percent of respondents indicated that they had obtained antibiotics without a prescription and 16 percent would consider doing so, which was highly concerning. Their motivation was often that they were unhappy with or did not trust healthcare.\" The researchers only found a few publications on the subject, most of which dealt with related phenomena or pharmaceuticals in general. However, no study had examined the issue specifically for antibiotics, or why some people circumvent society's rules that are intended to control antibiotic use. We therefore went ahead with a large study using the SOM Institute's Swedish Citizen Panel, with several thousand people who make up a more representative sample of the population as a whole, enabling us to examine the hypothesis that trust in healthcare plays an important role in this phenomenon.\" Christian Munthe, Study's Lead Author One of their main findings was that the proportion of Swedes who have obtained or want to obtain antibiotics without a prescription is lower than the pilot study suggested. At the same time, almost twice as many - just under 5percent of the respondents - would be willing to do so in the future compared to those who reported having done so (2.3percent). The other main finding is that trust in healthcare - or lack of trust - outweighed all other potential explanatory factors, such as level of education and concerns about one's own health. \"Because we know that trust in healthcare varies widely from country to country, our results provide a strong reason for countries with trust rates that are lower than the Nordic countries to review the situation and put measures in place if it turns out that many people are obtaining antibiotics without prescriptions.\" The researchers believe that Sweden also has good reason to monitor this issue in view of how many people are prepared to buy antibiotics without prescriptions in the future. \"It is also important to consider the need to maintain and strengthen trust in healthcare when devising strategies to limit antibiotic use.\" University of Gothenburg Munthe, C., et al.

The study, led by researchers from Columbia University and includes University of Michigan scientists, also found that another 22% have mild cognitive impairment. People with dementia and mild cognitive impairment are more likely to be older, have lower levels of education, and to be racialized as Black or Hispanic. Men and women have similar rates of dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Although dementia and mild cognitive impairment are known to be common in the United States, accurate, up-to-date measures of their national prevalence were scarce. “Because the HCAP study is part of the nationally representative and long-running Health and Retirement Study, these data not only show the burden of dementia now, but will be used in the future to track the trends in dementia burden in the decades ahead,” said study co-author Kenneth Langa, the Cyrus Sturgis Professor in the U-M Medical School, a research professor in the Institute for Social Research, and Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System. “Following those trends will be especially important given the likely impact of COVID and other recent population health changes on the risk for dementia in the coming decades.” The study was published in the journal JAMA Neurology. The study was based on data on 3,500 individuals in the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) Project, part of U-M's nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Between 2016 and 2017, each participant completed a comprehensive set of neuropsychological tests and in-depth interviews, which were used to develop an algorithm for diagnosing dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Rates of dementia and mild cognitive impairment rose sharply with age: 3% of people between 65 and 69 had dementia, rising to 35% for people aged 90 and over. Such data are critical for understanding the causes, costs, and consequences of dementia and mild cognitive impairment in the United States, and for informing policies aimed at reducing their impact on patients, families, and public programs.” Jennifer J. Manly, Study's Lead Author and Professor of Neuropsychology in Neurology at the Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center and the Taub Institute for Research in Aging and Alzheimer's disease at Columbia University “With increasing longevity and the aging of the Baby Boom generation, cognitive impairment is projected to increase significantly over the next few decades, affecting individuals, families, and programs that provide care and services for people with dementia.” The economic impact of dementia, including unpaid family caregiving, is estimated to cost $257 billion per year in the United States and $800 billion worldwide. Unlike previous large studies of dementia in the United States, participants in the new study are representative of older adults, and the researchers could examine differences in the national prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment by age, race and ethnicity, gender and education. The data show a disproportionate burden of dementia among older adults who self-identified as Black or African American, of mild cognitive impairment among older adults who identify as Hispanic, and both categories of cognitive impairment among people who had fewer opportunities to obtain education. David Weir, a research professor at ISR's Survey Research Center, is the principal investigator of the HRS, and co-author of the current study. “Large, diverse and nationally representative population studies are essential to identifying the kinds of disparities shown here,” Weir said. “This study caps over a decade of development of methods to bring robust diagnostic tools out of the clinic and into the population.” Langa is the principal investigator of the HCAP study. Weir and Langa are co-principal investigators of the HCAP International Network. Langa, Weir and collaborators developed the HCAP protocol prior to implementing it in the U.S. in 2016 as part of the HRS. The HRS HCAP project is also part of an international network of studies on dementia using the same study protocol to collect comparable data on dementia in 15 countries around the world. This will allow researchers to gauge and compare the burden of dementia in low-, middle-, and high-income countries now and into the next decade. The other contributors are: Richard N.

Researchers at Tokyo University of Science have previously reported on the oxytocin-induced reversal of impaired synaptic plasticity triggered by amyloid β peptide (25-35) (Aβ 25-35 ). They now show that an oxytocin derivative with modifications to enhance brain perfusion can reverse Aβ 25-35 -induced cognitive impairment in mice. The cognitive decline and memory loss observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is attributed to the accumulation of β-amyloid protein (Aβ), which impairs neural function in the brain. Experimentation has shown that oxytocin, a peptide hormone primarily responsible for parturition, bonding, and lactation, also regulates cognitive behavior in the rodent central nervous system (CNS). This finding, along with the identification of oxytocin receptors in CNS neurons, has spurred interest in the potential role of oxytocin in reversing memory loss tied to cognitive disorders like AD. However, peptides like oxytocin are characterized by weak blood-brain barrier permeability, and so can only by efficiently delivered to the brain via intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration. ICV, however, is an invasive technique which is impractical to implement clinically. Delivering peptides to the CNS via intranasal (IN) administration is a viable clinical option. Prof. Chikamasa Yamashita at Tokyo University of Science recently patented a method to increase the efficiency of peptide delivery to the brain, by introducing cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and a penetration accelerating sequence (PAS) through structural modifications. Previous work had confirmed that both CPPs and the PAS benefit the nose-to-brain delivery pathway. Now, a group of researchers, led by Prof. Akiyoshi Saitoh and Prof. Jun-Ichiro Oka, leveraged this approach to prepare an oxytocin derivative: PAS-CPPs-oxytocin. Their findings were published online in Neuropsychopharmacology Reports on 19 September 2022. We have previously shown that oxytocin reverses amyloid β peptide (25-35) (Aβ 25-35 )-induced impairment of synaptic plasticity in rodents. We wanted to see if PAS-CPPs-oxytocin could be delivered more efficiently to the mouse brain for clinical application, and if it improved cognitive functional behavior in mice.\" Prof. Jun-Ichiro Oka The group first developed an A\u0026β 25-35 peptide-induced amnesia model by supplying Aβ 25-35 to the mouse brain using ICV delivery. During the course of the study, the spatial working and spatial reference memories of these mice were evaluated using the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. After confirming that memory was affected in Aβ 25-35 -impaired mice, PAS-CPPs-oxytocin and native oxytocin were administered using the IN and ICV routes respectively, to see if learning and memory improved in the treated mice. Finally, the distribution of the IN-administered oxytocin derivative in brain tissue was profiled by imaging of a fluorescent-tagged oxytocin derivative. The results of this study were quite promising! The tagged PAS-CPPs-oxytocin showed distribution throughout the mouse brain following its IN administration. While the ICV administration of native oxytocin improved test outcomes in both the Y-maze and MWM tests, the IN administered PAS-CPPs-oxytocin yielded memory improving effects in the Y-maze test. Hailing the team's discovery, Prof. Oka says,\"My team is the first to show that the oxytocin derivative can improve the Aβ 25-35 -induced memory impairment in mice. This suggests that oxytocin may help reduce the cognitive decline we see in Alzheimer's disease.\" Why are these findings clinically useful? Prof. Oka explains the broader implications of their work,\"The oxytocin derivative enters the brain more efficiently. Furthermore, since IN delivery is a non-invasive procedure, this modified version of the hormone could potentially be a clinically viable treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\" Tokyo University of Science Takahashi, J., et al.

The Worm was… The post “I’m The Only Player in NBA History To Build An Image Without Nike or Adidas”: Dennis Rodman Once Boasted About the Sheer Uniqueness of his Eccentricity appeared first on The SportsRush.\nBasketball has seen superstars and cult icons of various types. None of these, however, hold even a candle to the persona and the myth that became . The Worm was one of the most influential basketball players of his time. Both in his pioneering style of defending on the court, and for his wild and often irrational seeming actions off it. Rodman saw considerable criticism at the time for various reasons. However, it is important to note that mental health issues and remedies weren’t particularly in the mainstream during Rodman’s playing years. Everyone saw the maverick, but not what led to Rodman’s maverick nature. Inspecting the same, it becomes very evident that The Worm struggled aplenty with mental health issues. And this realization combined with the narrative surrounding him has led to a bold claim from the former Bulls and Pistons star. Rodman, , stated that he was the only player not to be moulded by brand endorsements. The Worm’s personality and all aspects of it that came along with it, was 100% Rodman and nothing else. In an era where brand endorsements and the money surrounding it dictated a lot, Rodman has a good case for validation of his claim therein. Rodman was one of a kind and played to no rules. Clauses of an endoresement contract would have been the last of The Worm’s concerns during the wild period of his career. The Worm also went on to state that he would only be one of many if he played today. In his own words, An emotional Rodman went on to add that I Eras can indeed define legacies. Since Rodman, there have been many more NBA players who have lived out similarly happening legacies – however, none of them have arguably seen the spotlight as The Worm did. Dennis Rodman was a sort of Draymond Green before Draymond Green. Seeing a defender of Green’s ilk thrive in today’s game despite being a poor shooter, there is reason to believe that Rodman could have done a job today too. Rodman was mostly employed in the forward spot, but was one of the greatest rebounders the game has ever seen. Dennis has also been widely cited as the best defender of his era. These two skills are translatable to any era and would make Rodman a serviceable NBA player at the least. A fierce one-on-one defender who doesn’t ask for many touches in offense is a GM’s dream. One such glue guy needs to feature to make any lineup work. Rodman would have been an ideal glue guy of such requirement today, as he was in his peak. One of those players who never took anything for granted, The Worm guaranteed 100% hustle on the court. Another quality no one can pass on, eras aside. So, yes. Rodman, would have been a glue guy in a contender even in today’s game. With access to better mental health conditioning, he may even have had a less “eventful” NBA career.

The \"Living With Data\" project sought to understand people's perceptions of how data about them is collected, analyzed, shared and used (\"data uses\") in three public sectors: welfare, health and public service media. The research found that people are concerned and often confused about commercial companies accessing, using and profiting from data initially gathered for the social good , such as health data , or by public sector organizations like the NHS. The research shows clarity about commercial involvement in public sector data uses may reduce confusion, but it won't reduce concerns. It was found that people who know most about data uses are, in fact, the most concerned about them. Of particular concern was the involvement of big tech companies like Amazon and Palantir in the NHS COVID-19 Data Store. Only 5% of people support commercial companies profiting from the use of personal data, and only one in ten are not concerned about commercial companies being involved in providing public services like health or welfare. Experts say this finding highlights the urgent need for public sector organizations to review their data-driven systems, especially those from which commercial companies can profit. Professor of Digital Society Helen Kennedy, from the University of Sheffield, said, \"One way to do this is for public sector data practitioners to consider alternative ways of delivering data services. This won't be easy due to the global monopoly on the provision of these services, but it's not impossible. Changes to the data ecosystem could give the public more confidence in the use of their personal data that policymakers and users are keen to see.\" Different demographic groups have differing concerns about what their data is used for, demonstrating that social inequalities also play a role in shaping people's attitudes to data uses. Disabled people were found to be more positive about the sharing of health data than people who did not have a disability, and white people trusted the police's data uses more than Black, Asian and other racially minoritized people. The research also found that older people trusted their GP more than younger people , and LGBTQ+ people trust health organizations less than heterosexual cisgender respondents. However, despite these differences, there were also similarities. The research found that people from different groups were aware that data uses can reinforce inequalities, and they don't want data uses to have negative consequences for people from disadvantaged or minority communities . For example, there is concern that people who don't have access to the relevant technology in their homes are excluded from using data-driven systems. They want data-driven systems to be inclusive \"for all communities,\" as one participant in the research commented. Professor Kennedy added, \"Data policymakers and data practitioners need to acknowledge that there is widespread concern about the potentially discriminatory impacts of different data-driven systems. Then they need to address this problem. The way society uses data needs to change so it can eliminate harms and its use is in the public or social interest. Sometimes, in order to do these things, specific data uses need to stop, such as those that deepen inequalities. Regardless of how well data uses are currently communicated, the public will continue to be concerned if these changes are not made.\" The report recommends that eliminating harms on people from disadvantaged and minority groups and ensuring data uses are in the public or social interest should drive change.

That would be on top of the largest-ever release of 180 million barrels, approved earlier this year as a tool for bringing down retail fuel prices. Back then, experts warned this tool could hurt its wielder. Now, the danger seems to be even greater. “We remain very able, very vigilant: if we need to deal with additional challenges with supply, with affordability, we’ll have additional opportunity with the SPR if we need to do more sales into the future beyond that December time period,” one senior administration official told the Financial Times this week. This makes further sales from the SPR virtually a certainty: analysts expect prices to rise in December after the European Union embargo on Russian crude comes into effect, which will happen on the 5 th of the month. With OPEC+ reducing output by about a million barrels daily from November, this means that the supply of crude globally will tighten in the coming months. And when supply tightens, prices rise. Many see Biden’s latest move as a way of earning credit for the Democrat government ahead of the midterm elections. Biden himself says there is no political motive behind the SPR release strategy. And Goldman Sachs analysts just said this week that SPR releases would have only a modest effect on prices. In a note last week, they wrote that they expected the White House to release another 16 million barrels in 2023 “from FY2023 Congressionally mandated sales” but that those sales, first, would depend on oil prices and, second, would only have a limited impact on prices of less than $5 per barrel. The biggest problem with using the SPR as a way of regulating oil prices is that, being a strategic reserve, it would be dangerous to draw too much from it. Another 16 million barrels on top of the 180 million approved for release this year should not make a major difference in inventory levels, but observers are already getting nervous about those levels. At a little over 400 million barrels, the current amount of oil in the SPR is not enough for a month of consumption in case of emergency. One might point out that the U.S. cannot consume only locally produced oil for any length of time, which makes the SPR redundant, but it could certainly trade it for other blends should such a need arise. It seems not everyone is really buying the assurance that there is no political motive for the new release plans. Indeed, as early as the original reserve release plan, many commentators in the media argued that with it, Biden wanted to try and make sure the Democrats win the midterms or at least do not lose them very badly because of high retail fuel prices. “After the Opec meeting and with the midterms in mind, the administration needed to be seen doing something — and that seems to be announcing more SPR barrels that were already planned,” Energy Aspects’ Amrita Sen told the FT this week. What this means is that the administration is, for all its talk of all tools on the table, severely short of actual tools. There must be awareness in the White House that the SPR is a double-edged sword, and wielding it is quite risky. Yet they are wielding it for lack of a better option. There is only one other tool on that White House table that is even riskier: an export ban. The idea has only been mentioned in a general way, with assurances that nobody is seriously considering it, although some legislators have called for precisely that: ban exports, and keep prices low for Americans. Critics have pointed out that the likelihood of success from the use of that tool is rather low, with Goldman analysts warning earlier this month that a ban on exports could push both oil and fuel prices sky-high and still create shortages at home. It is, then, a question of choosing the lesser evil. And the lesser evil appears to be releasing additional barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve “responsibly where it makes sense to stabilize markets,” per Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk, as reported by Reuters. So, while OPEC tightens supply, the U.S. will stand ready to continue boosting it from its strategic reserve. And it will have to be careful not to deplete this reserve too much because the more oil released now, the more oil will need to be purchased later to replenish the reserve. It is perhaps not the most elegant way of solving the gasoline price conundrum that has made life harder for the Biden administration this year. But it appears to be the only realistic way of trying to solve it. The alternative is even more unpalatable.

This breakthrough has been led by Professor Sung Ho Park and his research team in the Department of Biological Sciences at UNIST, in collaboration with a research team, led by Professor Goo Taeg Oh from Ewha Womans University. Microglia, the primary immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), are known to eliminate unwanted germs and debris and remove dying neurons. In this study, the research team classified a new type of microglia with enhanced antioxidant function and markers similar to those of disease-associated microglia (DAM), designated them as stroke-associated microglia (SAM). Through animal experiments, the research team demonstrated that the presence of the typical antioxidant gene, Peroxiredoxin-1 (Prdx1), protects against acute I/R injury and is required for SAM activation and the consequent reduction of microglial cell death and inflammatory responses. In addition, after performing transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) surgery to induce ischemic stroke in mice, the research team found that Prdx1−/− mice were more severely injured by acute I/R injury, as confirmed by TTC staining, neurological deficit scores, motor tests, and the survival rate, indicating that Prdx1 has a protective function. In this study, we have, for the first time, identified a specialized and distinctive type of microglia with enhanced antioxidant function in stroke mice. Prdx1-dependent SAM may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for protecting microglial function and treating brain I/R injury,\" He adds, \"Although this new cluster will require further study, our findings provide a new perspective that Prdx1-mediated microglial heterogeneity is important in ischemic stroke.\" Professor Sung Ho Park, UNIST This study has been jointly participated by Wonhyo Lee, a doctoral researcher within the Department of Biological Sciences at UNIST and Sinai Kim, a doctoral researcher within the Department of Life Sciences at Ewha Womans University, as first authors.

Nearly three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds are full, according to national data compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services. Some areas are seeing pediatric hospitals full, including the Washington, DC , and Boston areas. Multiple viruses are behind the surge. As Ars reported earlier, health officials have warned about a surge in adenoviruses and enteroviruses , both common childhood respiratory viruses. One enterovirus, called EV-D68, is associated with a polio-like neurologic condition called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in young children, and health officials are bracing for a subsequent uptick in AFM cases. So far, the CDC has not seen such a rise this fall. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does, however, indicate a skyrocketing rate of cases of RSV— respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus . RSV is a common respiratory infection that produces cold-like symptoms in most people but can turn life-threatening in a small percentage of cases, particularly those in infants and young children with specific underlying health conditions. RSV typically rises later in the winter, with peaks in recent pre-pandemic years during late December. But, circulation of the virus began rising in late summer this year, and cases are now high, with the latest weekly case count from October 15 at over 7,000 , according to CDC data . The peak of RSV cases in 2021 saw weekly counts mostly around 4,000. Advertisement Enlarge / Flu-like activity is off to an early start with this year's data marked on the left with red triangles. CDC FluView And RSV isn't the only virus getting an early start this fall. Flu circulation is also off to an unusually strong start, and officials worry that it could also be a particularly bad flu season. The brisk rise of cold-weather viruses has experts doubling down on calls for flu shots and COVID-19 boosters. Although reported cases of COVID-19 are not showing signs of a dramatic upswing, the use of at-home testing makes official case counts difficult to interpret, and experts anticipate that a winter wave of COVID-19 is on the horizon, if not already starting. \"I think now's a prudent time to not just get the COVID booster, the new bivalent vaccine, but also the flu vaccine,\" former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a Sunday interview on CBS News' Face the Nation . \"Right now, we have flu cases picking up. It looks like this may be a more aggressive flu season. The predominant strain right now is H3N2, and the vaccine appears to be a good match for the strain.\" As such, the vaccine looks like it will be \"quite protective,\" he said, and now is \"a good time to get it.\" As for why this fall and winter are shaping up to be so rough, experts speculate it's a combination of pandemic-related disruptions. The global explosion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, subsequent lockdowns, and pandemic mitigation efforts wrecked normal transmission cycles of garden-variety respiratory viruses. Additionally, the reprieve from common viruses has created a larger-than-normal pool of susceptible young children as well as adults with waning immunity from past exposures.\narstechnica\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/childrens-hospitals-fill-up-amid-up-early-surge-in-respiratory-infection/","tags":["Science","adenovirus","AFM","CDC","Children's Hospital","COVID-19","enterovirus","flu","flu season","Infectious disease","pediatric","Respiratory illnesses","respiratory infections","RSV"],"title":"Children’s hospitals fill up amid up early surge in respiratory infections"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"“Humble guy who wants to learn and improve” – Graham Potter names Chelsea star who has ‘impressed’ him on and off the pitch sportskeeda\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/humble-guy-who-wants-to-learn-and-improve-graham-potter-names-che/","tags":["Football"],"title":"“Humble guy who wants to learn and improve” – Graham Potter names Chelsea star who has ‘impressed’ him on and off the pitch"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"“I think it’s more a team thing” – Graham Potter offers interesting opinion on concern about Raheem Sterling’s form at Chelsea sportskeeda\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/i-think-its-more-a-team-thing-graham-potter-offers-interesting/","tags":["Football"],"title":"“I think it’s more a team thing” – Graham Potter offers interesting opinion on concern about Raheem Sterling’s form at Chelsea"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"More intensive prostate cancer screening may reduce the risk of metastatic cancer later In the face of conflicting evidence over the risks and benefits of routine prostate cancer screenings, a large, longitudinal analysis found Veterans Health Administration medical centers with lower prostate screening rates had higher rates of metastatic prostate cancer cases in subsequent years than centers with higher screening rates.\nnews-medical\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/more-intensive-prostate-cancer-screening-may-reduce-the-risk-of-metastatic-/","tags":[],"title":"More intensive prostate cancer screening may reduce the risk of metastatic cancer later"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"Systematic review uncovers new links between the thyroid and the heart Systematic review of 32 studies with 1.3 million participants uncovers new connections between the thyroid and the heart.\nnews-medical\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/systematic-review-uncovers-new-links-between-the-thyroid-and-the-heart/","tags":[],"title":"Systematic review uncovers new links between the thyroid and the heart"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"All The Harry Potter Movies Return To HBO Max, Bringing 10 Star Trek Movies With Streaming services and licenses are weird, and that means that the Harry Potter series, despite being Warner Bros. productions, sometimes leave HBO Max, a Warner Bros.

Sometimes, I genuinely wonder if the British electorate has a humiliation kink. Maybe it’s because I’m not invested in conservative ideology or feel opposed to many of their core values, but when I come across people who remain ardent Tories, nothing else makes sense to me. Sometimes, I genuinely wonder if the British electorate has a humiliation kink. But perhaps one of the most head-scratching moments of this whole ordeal was how Boris Johnson’s supporters were pushing for him to make a comeback following Liz Truss’ disastrous 44 days as prime minister. After a short-lived campaign, Johnson ruled out the possibility Sunday. But that there was even a chance that he could be a candidate after he resigned in disgrace following his mishandling of a sexual misconduct issue within his party speaks volumes. But before I go into that, let me catch you up quickly on the level of embarrassment we’ve been experiencing in the U.K. During Truss’ short premiership, she lost two crucial members of her Cabinet (she fired her finance minister and her home secretary resigned). She also tanked the economy, U-turned on a number of her plans like tax cuts and then looked on as her new finance minister reversed the majority of her policies mere days after she vehemently defended them. Things got so bad that the tabloid newspaper The Daily Star created a YouTube livestream where a head of unrefrigerated lettuce was placed next to a photo of Truss to see which one would survive the longest. Many of us thought Truss’ catastrophic time as leader was inevitable, given that before she became prime minister, she was most famous for her rant about cheese. Another thing that felt just as inevitable was that, as the government once again fell to pieces, it was being cobbled back together without a general election. Instead, Sunak was put into power exclusively by Conservative members of Parliament. Because his most probable opponent, Penny Mordaunt, dropped out at the eleventh hour, he was the only candidate left standing. He won by default without the vote being decided online by all Conservative Party members, as planned. Of course, limiting the decision of a new prime minister to the members of one party alone is undemocratic, but the fact that Sunak was elected by a select number of MPs (who arguably had their own agendas) and not a single member of the general public is borderline dictatorial. Four of our last five prime ministers have been chosen without a general election. While it is still feasible for one to be called, U.K. law means it is pretty much at the prime minister’s discretion whether a general election happens before January 2025 — when the next one is due to take place. Of course, limiting the decision of a new prime minister to the members of one party alone is undemocratic. But as predictable as this chain of events was, one thing that I genuinely didn’t expect was the media, members of Parliament and the public touting Johnson to become prime minister again. From tweets by MPs to more lengthy endorsements — with one since-deleted pro-Johnson article by MP Nadhim Zahawi being published minutes after news broke that Johnson wouldn’t move forward with his leadership campaign after all — the support he received was striking. Now, all these public figures have had to make an embarrassing U-turn. Even worse than Johnson receiving MP endorsements — he claimed that he had reached the all-important benchmark of the 100 backers needed to make his leadership bid official — was the fact that people outside the Westminster bubble seemed willing to give him another chance. A recent petition, for example, called “Bring Back Boris” surpassed 25,000 signatures before it was shut down. At the same time, recent data by YouGov also showed that the majority of Conservatives (who, again, were the ones meant to vote for our future prime minister) wanted to see Johnson return as leader. Local media also showed people crying out for Johnson to return. The most concerning thing was that some news outlets acted like Johnson’s becoming prime minister again was a credible way forward after everything he had done. A number of the right-wing tabloids, for instance, treated Johnson’s potential as some kind of “soft launch” or heroic last chance saloon. The Daily Express talked about Boris “bouncing back,” while The Sun teased that Johnson was “eyeing the mother of all comebacks.” The most concerning thing was that some news outlets acted like Johnson’s becoming prime minister again was a credible way forward after everything he had done. It goes back to what I said earlier about the humiliation kink. Why else do so many people keep going back to someone with such blatant contempt for them? It really doesn’t make sense. He unlawfully prorogued or cut short Parliament’s time to discuss his Brexit bill in 2019; ignored scientists’ advice about Covid-19 lockdown procedures; continually flouted the very lockdown rules he instilled, having boozy parties while people attended Zoom funerals for their grandmas. That just scratches the surface of the damage he did as prime minister. The economic prosperity he promised on the side of a bus was replaced with what is now being dubbed a “cost of living crisis,” with energy bills and inflation reaching record highs and the likelihood of energy blackouts this winter. There’s no doubt that, in the short time she was in charge, Truss made things a lot worse, but the problems we’re facing as a country have been present longer than her 44 days in office. Her consecutive blunders didn’t come out of the blue. They were a direct result of the gaping hole Johnson dug in his three-year premiership. The possibility that he could’ve been given another chance — especially so soon after his disgraceful departure — is alarming. As the country shifts its focus to Sunak, it may soon be easy to forget that Conservative members of Parliament and the public really thought it would be good for the country to have Johnson back. But we should not forget. To move on as a country, we have to stop repeating the same mistakes. That means the public must continue to push for general elections so that the power of who gets to lead us is always in the hands of the people.

Against the dollar, the pound remained steady at $1.1303. Relief among investors was clear as gilt yields fell sharply. UK bonds posted some of their biggest gains on record as investors bet incoming PM Rishi Sunak will turn the page on weeks of turmoil dogging the nation's markets and restore credibility to economic policymaking. Short-dated notes led the rally with the two-year yield falling by the most since 1993 after Sunak - a former chancellor who had issued a warning over Liz Truss ' \"fairy tale\" tax cuts - emerged as the winner in the race to succeed her. The gains were supercharged as traders pared bets on future rate hikes. The pound rose too, before falling 0.4% to $1.13 as of 5.42pm in London. It's languishing well below the peaks reached during the first leadership contest over the summer, weighed down by huge economic headwinds ahead (the outlook for the UK's credit score was revised to negative by Moody's Investors Service on Friday). Britain's main equity indexes closed higher on Monday after Sunak looked set to become the next PM following other candidates exiting the race. The blue-chip FTSE 100 gained 0.6%, while the domestically focused FTSE 250 index jumped 0.8%. Truss resigned last Thursday following a market meltdown that pushed yields to their highest in years, forced the central bank to step in to stabilise markets and eventually prompted her to backtrack on plans for a vast fiscal stimulus. Investors expect Sunak will draw a line under the economic damage. \"For now, it's relief that 'total chaos' is over,\" said Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services. \"His credit with markets comes from having been a steady hand as chancellor and being a polished communicator who is not going to 'go off piste' like the Truss government.\" For his part, Sunak was quick to issue a warning on Monday that the UK faces a \"profound economic challenge\". The two-year gilt yield dropped 37 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) on Monday to end at 3.43%. Longer notes also rallied hard, sending the 10-year yield to 3.75%, the lowest since the day former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng first announced his so-called mini budget. Attention is already turning to next week - the next Bank of England meeting. While a 75bps hike is still fully priced, expectations of a bigger increase have faded now.\ntoi\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/uk-bonds-see-record-gain-with-sunak-as-pm/","tags":[],"title":"UK bonds see record gain with Sunak as PM"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"“Sorry I Won the Fight” – Sean O’Malley Apologizes for Victory Over Petr Yan at UFC 280 Sean O’Malley posts pic on social media apologizing for win over Petr Yan at UFC 280.

Despite the ringside decision, many outlets scored the match in Yan’s favor and the audience was not happy. While this is a massive victory for O’Malley Anne might help him move quickly up the ranks, the fan sentiment is certainly against him. In light of this fact, O’Malley put out a pic on social media to apologize for his victory. O’Malley looks sad and has his headphones on in the picture captioned: In a recent interview with barstool sports Devon white said that the fight against Jan was O’Malley’s McGregor versus Jose Aldo moment. What white meant was that a win against Yan would propel O’Malley to the top of his division just like McGregor when he knocked out although in 13 seconds add UFC 194. However, the controversial nature of the win now stands in the way of O’Malley’s future fights. McGregor had a clear victory that shot him to stardom in a spectacular fashion. The same cannot be said about O’Malley’s UFC 280 win. Further, many UFC fans and fight critics would still argue that Yan deserves a title shot against Jermaine sterling. Before his loss to O’Malley, Yan only had one loss to Sterling with the other one being ruled a no contest because of an illegal knee.

An absolute force of nature, Dwight steamrolled his way to superstardom. Drafted one year after LeBron James, it was rare to see two greats go back to back as Pick 1s, but 2003-04 was truly a great time for basketball. He was so great, even his greatest hater, , had to admit he was “nice”. According to him, he was athletic but could see some chinks in his armor. All he had to do was average 28 and 15 -said Shaq on a podcast, but the veteran center called Diesel a hater and ignored the advice. Nobody knows the value of hard work more than Shaq. He did not care about putting in the extra effort to get better, and his ceiling was raised for him. One of the most dominant big men in the game fell short of his expectations, and he rues every moment he did not make the extra push. To see Shaq giving Dwight the plaudits is extraordinary. A vociferous hater of the ex-Orlando center, Shaq said he was nice, which is the highest compliment he could have received. If only the defensive monster listened to his predecessor, Superman could have had a great successor. Dwight Howard was a certified monster. In the era of LeBron James, he led the Orlando Magic to an NBA final. The three-time defensive player of the year should have had more success, but he fell off a cliff once success got to his head. He tried to move to a big market team but suffered miserably. Once he made the move to the Lakers, everything went downhill. His attitude was exposed, he started getting injured quite often, and the game moved away from the post. Players like Brook Lopez overtook him in the skill department, and there was no turning back. The adage “You cannot teach an old dog new tricks” holds in the case of Dwight. He was out-skilled by his juniors, and it just kept going downhill. His acceptance to take a bench role in 2019 finally got him a championship ring, but that’s not how he should have gone. Dwight is currently without a team, and it looks like he’s about to end his career that way.\nthesportsrush\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/dwight-howard-was-better-and-more-athletic-than-me-shaquille-onea/","tags":["Basketball","Dwight Howard","Los Angeles Lakers","Orlando Magic","Shaquille O'Neal"],"title":"“Dwight Howard Was Better and More Athletic Than Me”: Shaquille O’Neal Expresses Disappointment Over Ex-Laker’s Dismissal of His Advice"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Americans See Another 10-Cent Drop In Gasoline Prices Prices at the gas pump have declined 10 cents in a week, according to AAA, which says recession fears and further releases of America’s strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) have contributed to the further declines.

The prices are less than one cent higher than they were a month ago, when the average was $3.700 per gallon, but still off the year-ago average of $3.385. “Global recession fears coupled with the Biden Administration’s plan to continue tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve into December has helped temper oil prices,” said Andrew Gross , AAA spokesperson. “This will help take the pressure off pump prices, benefitting drivers and their wallets.” The biggest drops in gasoline prices took place in Alaska, which saw a 33 cent fall in prices at the pump, followed by Calfironia (down 30 cents), Oregon (down 26 cents), Washington (down 24 cents, Nevada (down 20 cents) and Indiana and Michigan both down 15 cents. Gasoline is now cheapest in the states of Georgia and Texas, where consumers are paying an average of $3.20 per gallon. California remains the most expensive gasoline state, due to state taxes, with prices at the pump averaging $5.75 per gallon despite recent declines. The price of gasoline is a crucial factor in November 4 midterm elections. AAA notes that domestic gasoline demand is around 1 million barrels lower than at the same time last year, noting that better gas mileage could also be limiting demand and helping prices move downwards. \"If demand remains low and oil prices don't spike, pump prices will likely keep falling,\" the club stated.

This is a fairly standard approach to delivered/read in messaging apps from Signal to Telegram. iMessage just uses text, and that is the better approach in our opinion. Checkmarks are ubiquitous and might be more familiar to people, but being able to just read out “Delivered” and “Read” requires less translation, no matter how obvious the icons are. Fortunately, this looks to just be a test that at least three people have received. It’s not rolled out on devices we checked this afternoon, and hopefully Google’s testing will vindicate the current/old Messages approach to delivered and read.

Published today in JAMA Network Open , this study analyzed data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, which is supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and other entities of the National Institutes of Health. This study adds to our growing understanding of the associations between playing video games and brain development. Numerous studies have linked video gaming to behavior and mental health problems. This study suggests that there may also be cognitive benefits associated with this popular pastime, which are worthy of further investigation.\" Nora Volkow, M.D., NIDA Director Although a number of studies have investigated the relationship between video gaming and cognitive behavior, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the associations are not well understood. Only a handful of neuroimaging studies have addressed this topic, and the sample sizes for those studies have been small, with fewer than 80 participants. To address this research gap, scientists at the University of Vermont, Burlington, analyzed data obtained when children entered the ABCD Study at ages 9 and 10 years old. The research team examined survey, cognitive, and brain imaging data from nearly 2,000 participants from within the bigger study cohort. They separated these children into two groups, those who reported playing no video games at all and those who reported playing video games for three hours per day or more. This threshold was selected as it exceeds the American Academy of Pediatrics screen time guidelines, which recommend that videogaming time be limited to one to two hours per day for older children. For each group, the investigators evaluated the children's performance on two tasks that reflected their ability to control impulsive behavior and to memorize information, as well as the children's brain activity while performing the tasks. The researchers found that the children who reported playing video games for three or more hours per day were faster and more accurate on both cognitive tasks than those who never played. They also observed that the differences in cognitive function observed between the two groups was accompanied by differences in brain activity. Functional MRI brain imaging analyses found that children who played video games for three or more hours per day showed higher brain activity in regions of the brain associated with attention and memory than did those who never played. At the same time, those children who played at least three hours of video games per day showed more brain activity in frontal brain regions that are associated with more cognitively demanding tasks and less brain activity in brain regions related to vision. The researchers think these patterns may stem from practicing tasks related to impulse control and memory while playing videogames, which can be cognitively demanding, and that these changes may lead to improved performance on related tasks. Furthermore, the comparatively low activity in visual areas among children who reported playing video games may reflect that this area of the brain may become more efficient at visual processing as a result of repeated practice through video games. While prior studies have reported associations between video gaming and increases in depression, violence, and aggressive behavior, this study did not find that to be the case. Though children who reported playing video games for three or more hours per day did tend to report higher mental health and behavioral issues compared to children who played no video games, the researchers found that this association was not statistically significant, meaning that the authors could not rule out whether this trend reflected a true association or chance. They note that this will be an important measure to continue to track and understand as the children mature. Further, the researchers stress that this cross-sectional study does not allow for cause-and-effect analyses, and that it could be that children who are good at these types of cognitive tasks may choose to play video games. The authors also emphasize that their findings do not mean that children should spend unlimited time on their computers, mobile phones, or TVs, and that the outcomes likely depend largely on the specific activities children engage in. For instance, they hypothesize that the specific genre of video games, such as action-adventure, puzzle solving, sports, or shooting games, may have different effects for neurocognitive development, and this level of specificity on the type of video game played was not assessed by the study. \"While we cannot say whether playing video games regularly caused superior neurocognitive performance, it is an encouraging finding, and one that we must continue to investigate in these children as they transition into adolescence and young adulthood,\" said Bader Chaarani, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont and the lead author on the study. \"Many parents today are concerned about the effects of video games on their children's health and development, and as these games continue to proliferate among young people, it is crucial that we better understand both the positive and negative impact that such games may have.\" Through the ABCD Study, researchers will be able to conduct similar analyses for the same children over time into early adulthood, to see if changes in video gaming behavior are linked to changes in cognitive skills, brain activity, behavior, and mental health. The longitudinal study design and comprehensive data set will also enable them to better account for various other factors in the children's families and environment that may influence their cognitive and behavioral development, such as exercise, sleep quality, and other influences. The ABCD Study, the largest of its kind in the United States, is tracking nearly 12,000 youth as they grow into young adults. Investigators regularly measure participants' brain structure and activity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and collect psychological, environmental, and cognitive information, as well as biological samples. The goal of the study is to understand the factors that influence brain, cognitive, and social-emotional development, to inform the development of interventions to enhance a young person's life trajectory.

That means you'll be able to log into your PayPal account without having to type in your credentials, which in turn makes its quicker to check out your online shopping carts. PayPal says the option will first be available to users with iPhones, iPads and those visiting its website on Macs, but it will expand to additional platforms as they add support for the technology. Google released initial passkey support for Android and Chrome earlier this month and will launch the stable version, as well as an API for native Android apps, later this year. PayPal will also make passkeys available in other countries starting in early 2023.Passkeys use your biometrics to log into your accounts, but it's different from using your face or or fingerprints to auto-populate username and password boxes. With passkeys, you become the login. When you activate the option for an app, it creates a cryptographic key pair associated with your account. One of those keys is public, and that's what apps and services save to confirm your identity. The other key is private and is only stored on your devices, so hackers can't steal them if they ever get into the servers of apps you use. Apps and websites that support passkey then match the public key they have with your private key to make sure that it's you who's logging in. You can switch the feature on by logging into your account with a browser on desktop or mobile — the old way, with your user ID and password — and then choosing \"Create a passkey.\" After you authenticate using Apple Face ID or Touch ID, your passkey will be automatically generated. And since passkeys are synced with iCloud Keychain, you only need to do that once. If you're logging into your account on another device that doesn't have passkey yet, you'll have the option to generate a QR code after entering your user ID. You can then scan that QR code with an iPhone that does support passkey to be able to log in.\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/paypal-adds-passkey-support-in-the-us-for-easier-logins-and-check-outs/","tags":["Information Technology","Technology \u0026 Electronics","site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Mariella Moon"],"title":"PayPal adds passkey support in the US for easier logins and check outs"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Dhanashree Verma shares adorable Diwali post with husband Yuzvendra Chahal from Australia - check HERE Dhanashree recently travelled to Australia to support her husband and Team India for the ongoing mega event of cricket\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/dhanashree-verma-shares-adorable-diwali-post-with-husband-yuzvendra-chahal-/","tags":[],"title":"Dhanashree Verma shares adorable Diwali post with husband Yuzvendra Chahal from Australia - check HERE"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Oil Tanker Market In Disarray As EU Ban On Russian Crude Nears Six weeks before the EU embargo on Russian crude oil exports and the planned price cap on Russian oil enters into force, the global tanker and oil markets face increased uncertainty over who will ship Russia’s oil—and how—as of December 5.

Diwali supposedly marks the triumph of “light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance.” It is also associated with wealth and prosperity. In February 2020, Sunak took his oath of office as chancellor of the exchequer holding a copy of the Bhagavad Gita and celebrated Diwali by putting lights outside his official residence at Number 11 Downing Street. He will now be the first Hindu to become UK prime minister. His time in office will hinge on his ability to deliver a reasonable measure of prosperity to a country that is in dire economic straits.Continue Reading.

Indian- origin Sunak has the support of 142 members of the parliament, exceeding the 100-mark required to bag the top job at 10, Downing Street. Sunak was declared the next leader of Britain's Conservative Party by the chief of the 1922 Committee of Conservative lawmakers on Monday. This placed him on the course to be the country's next prime minister. The committee is tasked with selecting and changing the Conservative party's leader. \"I want to fix our economy, unite our party and deliver for our country,\" former chancellor Rishi Sunak said in a short statement. At age 42, he will be the youngest and the first non- white person to hold the post. The other candidate, former PM Boris Johnson, who entered the race again last week after cutting short a Caribbean holiday, ended his bid for the post yesterday in a surprise decision. He stated his inability to to lead \"a united party in parliament\". Rishi Sunak is the third Prime Minister UK had in seven months. Liz Truss, who had earlier pipped him to the post in the party's internal election and succeeded Boris Johnson, quit after only 45 days in office, on October 20. Sunak, as the next Prime Minister of UK, is tasked to steer the economically floundering nation days after his predecessor Liz Truss stepped down. This is Sunak's second shot at being the Prime Minister. The former U.K. Treasury chief was runner-up to Liz Truss in the contest to replace the scandal-plagued Boris Johnson as Conservative Party leader and prime minister. But Truss had no choice but to quit after a turbulent 45-day term, and Johnson abandoned a comeback attempt at the last minute, leaving Sunak a strong favourite to finally assume the office he narrowly missed out on less than two months ago. If he wins, Rishi Sunak will be Britain's first non-white leader and the first person of the Hindu religion to assume the job of the Prime Minister of the UK. At the age of 42, he will also be the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. Sunak is regarded as a political prodigy whose youthful looks, sharp suits, smooth and confident manner led to him being dubbed \"Dishy Rishi\" by the British media.Also read: Saudi - India Undersea Cables May Soon be a RealityAlso watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/indian-origin-rishi-sunak-set-to-take-the-top-job-of-uks-pm/","tags":["Breaking News,International News,Top Headlines,More,Feature,News Ticker"],"title":"Indian- Origin Rishi Sunak Set to Take the Top Job of UK's PM"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"नासिर हुसैन के नाम से नापाक हरकत कर रहा था पाकिस्तान, पूर्व इंग्लिश कप्तान ने लगा दी लंका Nasser Hussain India vs Pakistan: भारत के खिलाफ मुकाबला हारने के बाद पाकिस्तान अंपायर जिम्मेदार बता रहा है। इसके लिए पाकिस्तानी इंग्लैंड के पूर्व कप्तान के नाम का भी इस्तेमाल कर रहे। लेकिन पूर्व इंग्लिश कप्तान नासिर हुसैन के एक ट्वीट ने सभी की लंका लगा दी है।\nnavbharattimes\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/nasser-hussain-clarifies-as-his-fake-quote-goes-viral/","tags":[],"title":"नासिर हुसैन के नाम से नापाक हरकत कर रहा था पाकिस्तान, पूर्व इंग्लिश कप्तान ने लगा दी लंका"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Rishi Sunak Tells UK Tories To Unite As He Strives To Fix ‘Crisis’ Rishi Sunak called on his warring Conservative Party to unite as the UK’s incoming prime minister bids to fix the crisis facing the economy.\n(Bloomberg) -- Rishi Sunak called on his warring Conservative Party to unite as the UK’s incoming prime minister bids to fix the crisis facing the economy. (Bloomberg) -- Rishi Sunak called on his warring Conservative Party to unite as the UK’s incoming prime minister bids to fix the crisis facing the economy. Speaking less than an hour after emerging victorious in the race to succeed Liz Truss as premier, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer said his party needs to come together after ousting two prime ministers this year, according to a lawmaker present at Sunak’s address to MPs behind closed doors on Monday. Sunak spoke shortly after his last remaining rival, Penny Mordaunt, pulled out of the race for 10 Downing Street, urging her party to “unite and work together for the good of the nation.” That meant there was no need for a runoff vote among grassroots party members. It is a remarkable turnaround in Sunak’s political fortunes, after the former Chancellor of the Exchequer quit Boris Johnson’s government in July and then lost out to Truss in the last Tory leadership contest over the summer. But his repeated warnings that her plans would trigger economic chaos proved correct and put him in pole position when Truss’s premiership imploded. Johnson’s Shadow Even so, Sunak was no shoo-in given the bitterness and division in the Conservative Party. He’s still tarnished in the eyes of many Tory MPs for his role in Johnson’s downfall, and the former prime minister’s flirtation over the weekend with what would have been an outrageous comeback just months after being ousted briefly threatened to derail Sunak’s hopes. In the end, Johnson withdrew without ever showing he had the support of 100 Tory MPs needed to formally contest the leadership. Likewise, Mordaunt pulled out shortly before influential Tory MP Graham Brady was due to announce which candidates had surpassed that threshold. It effectively meant a coronation for Sunak, 42, who becomes the UK’s first Hindu prime minister and the country’s youngest in more than 200 years. Grassroots Tory members, who had the final say when Truss beat out Sunak last time, will have no input this time around. But Sunak now faces a daunting task to try to bring that unity to a party that has been through months of upheaval and is still tearing itself apart over fundamental issues including Brexit and the economy. Some Tory MPs even say the party no longer has a mandate to govern, after a second change of leader since Johnson won the general election in 2019. “It will now be impossible to avoid a GE,” former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said on Twitter. Tory ‘Psychodrama’ On Monday, there were signs that Tory MPs are prepared to rally behind their new leader. After Sunak’s address, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith -- a Brexiteer on the ideological right of the party -- told reporters: “It’s time to end this psychodrama.” And Alex Chalk, a Remainer from the party’s moderate One Nation faction hailed Sunak’s “incredible speech.” “We’ve got to move forward,” Chalk said. “He said it with an articulacy and a power that brought the room to life.” Truss’s decision to step down followed weeks of turmoil as investors jettisoned UK assets. Her economic plan, including borrowing to pay for massive tax cuts, rattled markets and turned voters further against the Tories in record numbers. A Long To-Do List for the UK’s Next Leader: Balance of Power After firing her first finance minister and long-time political ally, Kwasi Kwarteng, Truss brought in Jeremy Hunt -- who backed Sunak on Sunday -- to try to restore calm. Hunt managed that to a degree, but also put the government on course to impose another punishing round of austerity at a politically sensitive time as Britons struggle with soaring living costs. In a column for the Telegraph newspaper late Sunday, Hunt indicated that he and Sunak are aligned on how to tackle the economy. Sunak will “turn the page on what went wrong, take decisions in the national interest and rebuild the extraordinary potential of our economy,” Hunt said. Hunt is due to deliver a major statement on the Treasury’s tax-and-spending plans on Oct. 31, a date picked to better inform the Bank of England on how quickly it should raise interest rates. UK bonds surged at Monday’s open on expectations of a Sunak premiership.

Spending thousands on a GPU, only for it to be an empty box, save for a couple of useless weights.\nThat’s the situation a Newegg customer has apparently found themselves in after sharing an image of an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 box that should contain one of the world’s best graphics cards but instead contains some lumps of metal. Thankfully, in the replies to their Reddit post, it looks like the unlucky customer was able to get their money back – and we hope they can get their hands on an actual RTX 4090 soon – but their tale reminds us that we always need to be careful when buying online. And that advice becomes especially important as we enter November and Black Friday approaches.\n Analysis: how to avoid scams this Black Friday As we head into the Black Friday sale season, you should expect to see the internet flooded with discounts and Black Friday deals encouraging you to shop. But among these true bargains will be an awful lot of duds.\nWe’re not just talking about situations like the above example – where a user is seemingly scammed into buying one item because they believe it’ll be another – but discounts that aren’t what they appear to be and offers on items you’d be better off avoiding.\nSo what are some best practices you can follow to avoid Black Friday purchases that you come to regret?\nFor starters, you want to only shop at reputable sites that you recognize and that offer some kind of buyer protection. If you’re browsing an online store you’ve never heard of before, look into it. Googling “[Site name] legit” should bring up details about it on websites like Trustpilot. You’ll also likely see links to Reddit posts celebrating or bemoaning the site depending on if it's a hidden gem or a sham. If after your research you’re still not 100% sure, shop elsewhere – the potential extra savings aren't worth the risk.\nYou also want to make sure you're buying from the vendor themselves, and not a third-party that's using the site as a marketplace. Newegg, Amazon, and Walmart are some of the stores that allow other people to sell items on their sites, and while many third-party sellers are fine, there are some bad actors that can slip through the cracks.\nBlack Friday is a great time to find a bargain on a range of gadgets, but not every deal is as good as it looks. (Image credit: Future) Once the site has passed your checks, it’s time for you to check the quality of your desired product, too. Unfortunately despite their best efforts, online stores like Amazon are flooded with fake reviews. While you can use our guide on how to spot fake Amazon reviews to try and separate the real opinions from the mass-produced lies, we’d also recommend again googling the item and trying to find independent reviews for it if you can.\nIf you’re looking to pick up a Black Friday gaming laptop deal, a Black Friday OLED TV deal, a Black Friday air fryer deal, or even a Black Friday coffee machine deal, most likely the model you’re interested in has been reviewed by a publication like TechRadar. We aren’t incentivized to make a product sound better or worse than it really is, so if you want an opinion you can trust on a gadget you like, then read through our review and decide if it's something you want to buy.\nFinally, before you hit buy make sure the discount is as good as it seems. Ahead of Black Friday, it’s not uncommon for brands to raise their prices to then make discounts seem larger than they really are.

Pujara, who joined Sussex last year, made an enormous impact by scoring over 1000 County Championship runs, including a record breaking three double centuries and finished the season with an average of 109.4. The right-handed batter's stupendous form continued into the 50-over Royal London Cup, where he led the side in the absence of injured Tom Haines and guided the team to the semi-finals of the competition. In his nine Royal London Cup appearances, Pujara averaged 89.14 at a strike-right of 111.62, with a highest score of 174 off just 131 balls against Surrey. Promoted \"I am glad to be back with Sussex for the 2023 season. I thoroughly enjoyed my last stint with the club last season, both on and off the field and I'm looking forward to contributing to the team's growth and success in the coming year,\" Pujara said in a statement issued by the county side. Sussex Performance Director, Keith Greenfield, added: \"It is fantastic news that Cheteshwar will be returning in 2023, we all saw the class he showed with the bat and his performances, but he was also outstanding in our young dressing room as a world class role model for them to follow.\"\nndtv\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/cheteshwar-pujara-to-return-to-sussex-for-2023-county-season/","tags":["Cricket"],"title":"Cheteshwar Pujara To Return To Sussex For 2023 County Season"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"M2 iPad Pro reviews: Much like the M1 model, only a handful of people need it Alongside reviews of the new 10th-generation entry-level iPad, M2 iPad Pro reviews are also out – and here reviewers speak with one voice.

The bottom line is that it’s an incredible device, but more or less the same as last year’s M1 model, and very few people will benefit from the performance … (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Mashable says that it’s powerful, and Pencil Hover is a neat trick, but it’s otherwise the same as last year’s M1 model – and if you want the extra power, you should probably buy a MacBook. The sixth-gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which Apple sent me to review last week, is near identical to the fifth-gen iPad Pro in many key aspects. It has the same design, display, cameras, speakers, and battery. It’s exactly the same size and weight. It even has a Nano-SIM slot, just like last year’s iPad Pro, even though Apple has gone SIM-less on its new iPhone 14. It comes with the same storage options, ranging from 128GB all the way up to 2TB. It once again comes in the Space Gray and Silver colors. It supports the exact same accessories, and Apple hasn’t launched any new ones, for now. This is not an upgrade for people who want to flaunt their brand new iPad Pro. The major changes are the M2 processor and – if you really stretch the term “major” – support for Apple Pencil hover, the tech that makes the tablet’s display sense the proximity of Pencil and perform a simple task before you even touch it. Apple’s iPad Pro is for professionals, but only a small niche of professionals can truly use it as a daily driver. Changes boil down to the new M2 chip that’s inside, making the Pro even more powerful, but you’ll be better off with a laptop. TechRadar stacks the latest iPad Pro up against the iPad Air, and concludes that most people don’t need the Pro. You might think that the iPad Air 5 vs iPad Pro 2022 dilemma isn’t really much of a dilemma; after all, the new iPad Pro (2022) – launched alongside the new iPad 10.9 (2022) – brings top-grade laptop performance to the tablet format. But the iPad Air (2022) – Apple’s other big tablet launch from earlier in the year – is no slouch either […] The iPad Pro 2022 is (unsurprisingly) the better, more capable of the two. Its new Apple M2 chip means a healthy bump in performance, and its display – whichever size you opt for – is brighter, more fluid, and (in the case of the 12.9-inch Pro, at least) more vibrant. The Pro also gives you a more advanced camera system, Face ID authentication, improved connectivity, and enhanced Apple Pencil interactivity. But is all that worth the $200/£200 premium that Apple is charging for the 11-inch Pro? For most people, we suspect that it won’t be, as they’re functionally very similar. Indeed our review of the latest Pro notes that the iPad Air 5 offers the vast majority of the Pro’s features for a lot less. Tom’s Guide loves the display, M2 performance, Apple Pencil hover, and 5G support – but sees little advantage over the previous M1 version. I have mixed feelings about the new iPad Pro 2022. Objectively, it’s a well-designed device that delivers everything you’d expect from the premium iPad line. Watching video content, playing games, conferencing with others, web browsing, writing, drawing and more work as well as ever. The M2 chip powering the tablet should also make it fairly future-proof. It’s hard to knock the iPad Pro for what it offers. However, this tablet doesn’t exist in a vacuum. If you already own last year’s iPad Pro, you absolutely don’t need the new model unless you do heavy-duty design or video editing. The iPad Air 2022 is also a great option for most users due to its impressive performance and relative affordability compared to the iPad Pro. And for those who want one of the best Android tablets , the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 is another alternative. However, if you own an older iPad Air or iPad Pro, the iPad Pro 2022 could be just the upgrade you’ve been waiting for. ZDNet ‘s Jason Cipriani says he got to unexpectedly discover that there is zero real-life performance difference. He shares the view of many of us: that it’s the software that needs an update, not the hardware. The iPad Pro’s hardware continues to outpower the software. Although, with the addition of Stage Manager in iPadOS 16.1 and true external monitor support due before the end of the year, iPad Pro users have more hope than ever that the iPad is about to turn the corner. In my early hands-on preview for iPadOS 16, I wrote that the update fundamentally changed the way I use my iPad Pro. For the better; and I stand by that. I admittedly gave Apple the benefit of the doubt that any issues I’d experienced during early testing were bugs in a young beta and that by the time the official release arrived, those bugs would be ironed out. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case […] At one point during the last couple of days, I mistakenly picked up my iPad Pro thinking it was the M2 iPad Pro (they’re identical in design) and used it for an hour or so, the entire time questioning whether the performance boost I suddenly perceived was a placebo effect or not. Turns out, it was. Engadget echoes the point about the extra performance mattering to very few users. That new chip is by far the most notable change here. Otherwise, the design, screen, cameras, storage options, accessories and price are all the same. That’s not a big problem, though, because the iPad Pro was already an outstanding device — and the Liquid Retina XDR display Apple introduced on last year’s 12.9-inch model is still a simply outstanding screen. There are a couple new tricks here, like the Apple Pencil “hover” feature and the ability to shoot video in Apple’s ProRes codec, but by and large this iPad Pro isn’t angled at people who bought that M1 model. Instead, it’s just a case of Apple flexing its muscles by making the most powerful, spare-no-expense tablet that it can […] In a demo last week, Apple showed how the new iPad Pro can chew through apps like the forthcoming DaVinci Resolve and Octane X. The former is an intense video application that combines things like professional-level color correction, color grading, visual effects and much more, while Octane X is meant for 3D rendering. Both apps are pretty far outside things I’d use. Slashgear says that, like the M1 model, it’s an incredibly impressive technical achievement, but most of us don’t need the performance they offer. It was frankly astonishing when Apple added the M1 chipset to the iPad Pro in early 2021. For the first time, the Cupertino firm’s tablets had the same processing potential as its laptops, a narrowing-of-the-field that, though predicted by many, still felt borderline magical in a device that was fanless and still capable of lengthy battery life. As we’ve seen from the Apple M2 in laptops like the 2022 MacBook Air refresh, the delta between the generations of Apple Silicon hasn’t been quite as jaw-dropping as the leap from x86 to M1 was. Nonetheless, it’s tough to understate just what the offer is here: desktop-level grunt. The qualifier — which also lingers from previous, potent iPad Pros — is that how well you can take advantage of the power on offer depends on the whims of developers. DaVinci Resolve, Octane X, and Affinity Publisher users will all be getting updates later in the year that unlock features and processing speed that legitimately would’ve forced them to turn to the Mac version before now. That’s huge. There’s a sense nonetheless that there’s more here from the M2 than is really necessary for most iPadOS apps and iPad users. My typical workflow of email, messaging, browsing, writing, and watching the occasional video barely touches the sides, when you’re talking about a CPU that’s up to 15% faster than last year’s, and a GPU that’s up to 35% faster. Never has the fact that this is a pro machine, and not designed for everyone, been more stark. Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.

In the turbo-hybrid era, Wolff’s side was a group to envy till 2021, which dominated the entire grid. In 2012, the rivalry between the two sides was piqued, as the championship fight couldn’t have gone more intense. Even this year, Wolff became the biggest opposition to Red Bull amidst their budget breach controversy. So, Wolff has left no stone unturned to make things harder for Red Bull. But several years ago, his relations with the Austrian side weren’t bad, and he even represented them once. The Mercedes boss Wolff back when he was a GT driver, was sponsored by his compatriot and Red Bull owner Deiritch Mateshitz. The former Austrian driver claims he was proud of wearing Red Bull colours. “It was on a car that was sponsored by Red Bull but I was proud to wear those colours as a junior driver, GT driver back in the day, and being a Red Bull driver was something prestigious and I was proud to wear the overalls and the team kit,” said Wolff. However, Wolff didn’t continue his driving career for long after realising he wasn’t good enough. He then had a successful spell in the finance industry before he joined the business of F1, and the rest is history. Mateschitz became one of the biggest names when he involved his brand in several sports. From football and F1 to several adventure sports, Red Bull is everywhere. Wolff claims that Mateschitz used to invest a huge amount of his company’s profits in sports. He even credits the late billionaire as the biggest individual contributor to F1. “This one was for Dietrich.” Verstappen dedicates his win in Austin to Dietrich Materschitz ❤️ — ESPN F1 (@ESPNF1) Under Mateschitz’s guidance, Red Bull has won five F1 constructors’ titles and six drivers’ championships.

It’s almost as if he has a personal vendetta against the 4-time NBA Champion. The famous/infamous pundit has gained vast popularity with his campaign against the superstar. Some believe it might be due to the GOAT debate. With Bayless being a Michael Jordan fan, it is difficult for him to acknowledge LeBron’s right to the tag. And to stop his claim to being the GOAT, Bayless has taken it upon himself to criticize and scrutinize LeBron’s career and life. With the Lakers in the midst of a complete breakdown since last season, he has had ample reasons and justifications to go after LBJ. This time, he has reacted to Lakers losing their 3rd game of the season. And it’s safe to conclude he wasn’t kind to the squad or James. Also read: The former first-take host was tweeting while the Lakers were playing the Trail Blazers. Before the start of the fourth quarter, the Hollywood team was leading 83-78. They Portland 35-23 in the third quarter. However, Portland turned the game around in 4th. Skip Bayless in his tweet reacted to the loss. He claimed that LeBron James lacked the clutch gene. He had lost the ability to perform in high-pressure situations. He also took note of how the team gave away a 16-6 run and lost the game. Skip: “LeBron fallaway j to tie – way short! Some things never change. No clutch gene. Lakers give up a 16-6 run at home down the stretch, lose by two to Dame and Co.” — Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) This time, Skip is not the only one who is disappointed in the Lakers. The gold and purple proudly started the 2021-22 season with Russell Westbrook’s inclusion. Things turned south real soon and the momentum has completely been against them since. This season feels more like the continuation of the tragedy that was last year. The three-consecutive losses mean absolutely nothing to the overall seeding prospects of the team yet. However, that will change at a staggering pace. If they notch up a few more losses to their record, LeBron James and his team will risk missing another playoffs.

The elements included in this mineral and its derivatives Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) are less-toxic and abundant on Earth, which could be very advantageous for the development of more sustainable and low-cost technologies.\nOctober 24, 2022 feature by Ingrid Fadelli , Tech Xplore Kesterite (Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 , CZTS) is a sulfide mineral with a unique lattice structure that can be considered as derived from chalcopyrite CuInSe 2 (CIS) by substituting two atoms of In 3+ in the chalcopyrite by one atom of Zn 2+ and one atom of Sn 4+ . The elements included in this mineral and its derivatives Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 (CZTSSe) are less-toxic and abundant on Earth, which could be very advantageous for the development of more sustainable and low-cost technologies. Over the past few decades, material scientists and engineers have been exploring the possibility of using kesterite materials to create more affordable and sustainable solar cells. Despite extensive efforts in this direction, the highest power efficiency attained by kesterite solar cells is 12.6%, which was first reported in 2013. Researchers at Nanjing University of Posts \u0026 Telecommunications, Fudan University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and University of Washington have recently surpassed this decade-long record, developing a better performing kesterite/CdS interface that could enable the creation of solar cells with a 13% efficiency. This interface, presented in a paper published in Nature Energy , could enable the creation of more efficient and better performing kesterite solar cells. \"The Nature Energy paper builds on our previous work, which showed that the kesterites Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 (CZTSSe) and (Ag,Cu) 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 (ACZTSSe) absorbers fabricated from SnCl 4 based DMSO solution show improved device performance with the reduced recombination near kesterite/CdS interface,\" Hao Xin, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told TechXplore. \"The primary objective of the Nature paper was to understand the original of the defective heterojunction interface of kesterite/CdS and how thermal annealing greatly reduces the concentration of the defects.\" In their experiments, Xin and his colleagues showed that a kesterite/CdS heterojunction is constructed on a Zn-poor surface, as Zn 2+ dissolves during the chemical bath deposition process. As a result, Cd 2+ occupies site previously occupied by Zn and Zn 2+ is re-deposited into CdS, resulting in a defective interface with a lattice mismatched. To reconstruct the epitaxial interface, the researchers applied a technique known as low temperature annealing on the kesterite/CdS junction. This technique allowed them to drive the migration of Cd 2+ from the absorber layer back to the CdS site and Zn 2+ from the absorber bulk to the material's surface. \"The precursor films (fabricated from SnCl 4 based DMSO solution) have kesterite (Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 , CZTS) structures already formed, which takes a direct phase transformation grain growth mechanism to form CZTSSe/ACZTSSe absorber films during selenization,\" Xin said. \"Our approach avoids secondary phases and thus creates a uniform and less defective absorber.\" The researchers evaluated the kesterite/CdS interface they created in a series of tests and found that it outperformed previously created kesterite interfaces. Their initial fabrication method was found to significantly improve the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of solar cell devices, achieving certified efficiencies of 12.96% over a small-area (0.11cm 2 ) and 11.7% over a large-area (1.1cm 2 ). In the future, the experimental methods devised by Xin and his colleagues could enable the development of kesterite/CdS interfaces with more uniform absorber films. These interfaces could in turn be used to develop better performing kesterite solar cells. \"For the first time, we unveil how the kesterite/CdS heterojunction is constructed (based on Zn-poor surface) and why it is defective (due to occupation of Cd 2+ on Zn vacancy), which contrast with CIGS, from which kesterite is inherited,\" Xin added. \"In our next works, we plan to further engineer the defects of kesterites.\" Explore further Yuancai Gong et al, Sn4+ precursor enables 12.4% efficient kesterite solar cell from DMSO solution with open circuit voltage deficit below 0.30 V, Science China Materials (2020).

But, a Twitter user, who shared the video, claimed that Dhoni had offered him his seat, saying \"Your legs are too long, sit in my seat (Business Class), I'll sit in Economy.\" After the loss, Pakistan coach Matthew Hayden along with skipper Babar Azam talked to the team giving them a sigh of relief to not take any pressure now. In a video shared by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Babar was seen comforting his players who were shaken-up by the defeat against India, especially Mohammad Nawaz. \"No one should point fingers on one person, this should not happen, not in this team. As a team we have lost, as a team we will win. We have to stick to together, remember that. We have had good performances too. Look at those too.

In addition, they support all seven dhatus (tissues), especially Shukra dhatu, and lubricate the skin and microcirculatory channels (reproductive tissue).\nNew Delhi: These energies control various processes, including controlling the mind, the body, and diseases you are likely to contract or the diet you ought to eat. One of these energies is the Vata dosha, which controls bodily motion and motion-related processes. Ayurveda holds Vata accountable for our capacity for both physical \u0026 mental adaptabilities. It controls our nervous system, bones, and hearing. It is the energising force of the body and mind. Here are three lifestyle tips: Include almonds in your diet: In general, sweet, sour, and salty foods are excellent for balancing Vata. These tastes are regarded as a medicine for correcting Vata imbalance in Ayurveda because they increase qualities of warmth, moisture, and heaviness/groundedness to encourage regular digestion and balance Vata. For a healthy body constitution, it`s generally advised to consume foods that satisfy all six tastes (sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astringent). Almonds are one of the foods that can help balance Vata Dosha. Almonds are typically referred to as \"Vatada,\" \"Badam,\" or \"Vatma\" in Ayurvedic texts. They are considered \"madhura,\" or sweet, and have \"Snigdha,\" or unctuous properties, and are known as \"Vatahara\" and \"Pitta kara\" in terms of their action on doshas (Dosha Karma). Almonds work best to calm the Vata dosha due to their after-digestion sweet and warming qualities. In addition, they support all seven dhatus (tissues), especially Shukra dhatu, and lubricate the skin and microcirculatory channels (reproductive tissue). Practice Yoga: Yoga that calms the Vata dosha can balance all the doshas and provide radiant and beaming health. The asanas that are better suited for Vata balance should naturally becalming. These poses help alleviate anxiety symptoms and correct imbalances, such as bodyaches and constipation. Some of the asanas you could practice every day include Uttanasana (Standing Forward Bend Pose), Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Bend Pose), Balasana(Child`s pose), Supta Virasana (Reclined Hero Pose), Dhanurasana (Bow Pose) and Ustrasana(Camel pose). Adding Ashwagandha to your diet: Several naturally occurring herbs have Vata-optimisingproperties. The herb ashwagandha is renowned for its many Ayurvedic health advantages. Vata dosha imbalance is typically the cause of stress, which frequently manifests as irritability, insomnia, and fear. According to studies, by balancing Vata, taking Ashwagandha powder lessens the signs and symptoms of stress and anxiety. Ashwagandha, usually taken as a powder, can be diluted with water or warm milk and honey. Although it is always recommended to consult your ayurvedic physician for its accurate dose before consumption. This combination supports the reproductive system, builds strength, and balances Vata when taken before bed. It also promotes sound sleep patterns.\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/try-these-3-lifestyle-tips-for-balancing-vata-dosha/","tags":[],"title":"Try THESE 3 lifestyle tips for balancing Vata dosha"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Notice Asking Women Advocates To Stop \u0026lsquo;Arranging Hair In Open Court\u0026rsquo; Causes Uproar It is regularly seen that women advocates are styling their hair in open Court, which is disrupting the running of the Court,\" says a notice published by court on October 20,2022.\nNEW DELHI: An image of a court notice of Pune District Court, which senior Supreme Court advocate and well-known human rights activist Indira Jaising shared on Twitter on Sunday has caused quite an uproar on social media. The notice, dated October 20, 2022, instructs women's advocates to forgo hair styling. \"It is regularly seen that women advocates are styling their hair in open Court, which is disrupting the running of the Court,\" reads the controversial notice, which is undersigned by the Registrar of Pune District Court. Women's rights activists were thereby advised to refrain from such behavior. Jaising posted a picture of this warning along with the caption, \"Wow, now look! Who is distracted by women advocates and why!\" The number of likes for this tweet is now over 4,600, with 985 retweets and 237 quote tweets. The court's order is being criticised by online users as being sexist and discriminatory against women. Many among the Twitterati commented on the tweet about women advocates 'arranging their hair in open court, disturbing functioning of the court…' A Twitter user commented on Jaising's tweet saying, \"If they choose to get distracted by the mere sight of women tomorrow, would women advocates be barred as well?

According to a report, he told that this Miya Museum should be taken down immediately He also said that he won't allow the existence of the Miya Museum in Assam as the Miya community will never accept the Assamese Culture. The Miya Museum was opened to the public on Sunday. It is located in the Lakhipur in Dapkarvita in the Goalpara district of the state of Assam. It aims to preserve the culture and heritage of a minor section of people residing in the state. The small setup has old items related to the Miya community on display for all visitors. Apparently, these have been used by the community since a very old time.The inauguration event was attended by hundreds of members of the Miya community as well as invited guests and officials of the All AssamMiya Parishad among the dignitaries.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had previously rejected a proposal of former Congress MLA Sherman Ali Ahmed. He has proposed the of setting up a Miya Museum in Srimanta Shankardev Kalakshetra in the year 2020.

It is promoting guide aided travel for travellers to have an immersive local experience. Oddessemania is incidentally the first platform to facilitate pre-travel guide booking. Trained and experienced guides are onboarded to the platform (based on their specialty) for travellers to select them on the basis of the itinerary, the subject and their availability. The guides are specifically selected from the local community and trained and onboarded. The Oddessemania platform mainly allows travellers to plan their itinerary by using maps and plan the details of the trip visually. Travelers can also share itineraries, if they want, with family and friends. Oddessemania achieves multiple objectives by facilitating guide booking. Firstly the travellers get a local expert to guide them during the travel who ensures that they get an immersive experience. Secondly the local guides also ensure safety of the travellers. This is particularly important for solo travellers or small groups. Thirdly by engaging the local guide community it contributes positively to uplift the local economy. What was the understanding /insight or inspiration behind your entrepreneurial venture? The seed of entrepreneurship was sown in my mind when I was in college. I used to attend the seminars and workshops where the founders of the companies used to come and take sessions. I was inspired to work on my own and solve problems from that point of time only. Also, I and my co-founder are travel freaks. Since we are from the northeast we wanted to showcase our beauty, culture and tradition to everyone. We realised people outside the region have lot of misunderstandings about this region. We started Oddessemania keeping all these objectives in mind. We chose to make the guide booking platform because we observed that when people come to visit places they are not introduced to the local culture, tradition or the people of those places. They come through agencies that give them luxurious facilities and hardly contribute to the local economic growth. Most people residing in the offbeat places are dependent on tourists. The big 'moneyed' players take advantage of this fact and open up big franchisee of hotels or restaurants and this is not actually fair. The northeast is yet to be explored and we have to capitalise on our local communities. Therefore, it's now our mission through this startup to uplift the local communities and contribute to the local economy. What are the specific challenges and milestones of your journey so far? What is your vision and future roadmap? Well orienting the society (at large) to your idea is the main challenge that you face when you start your journey as an entrepreneur. Our idea is completely new so doing this was doubly challenging for us. Finding the correct mentor to guide us was another challenge. I and my co-founder Prantika Sarma are first generation entrepreneurs and hence we were easily prone to mistakes. We didn't have anyone to guide us and enlighten us about the correct ways. I would say that finding and forming the right team in a startup is a very big challenge because you need someone who is ready to do extra work and research while putting in creativity always. The members also have to believe in entrepreneurship and the idea that you chose to work on. Finding knowledgeable and creative people who align with the company values and goals is a real task. And obviously, funding is always a perennial challenge to start something new. Our company is boot strapped but some amount of fund is always required to scale up and finding the correct investor that believes in your idea is not at all easy. However, with all our efforts and proper mentorship, we have served 3000 plus customers till date and trained 80 plus guides to onboard them in our app. We also started experiential learning programmes among students and corporates and received a huge response and have already served 200 plus participants. We got incubated in Assam start-up, recognised by IIMCIP and DPIIT and received a soft loan and incubation from the Assam Downtown venture lab. Our website is one of the top travel websites in northeast India. And this happened because we worked on the basics during corona time. Recently, we also collaborated with Assam Tourism to train the registered guides and onboard them in our platform so that they are available to the tourists for booking. We are the official company to provide guides in Assam now. Our future plan is expand the guide system in different north-eastern states as well as in other parts of the country. Our platform is the first platform which is giving recognition and mass employment to the local youths as local guides. We also aim to expand in South Asian countries because the guide demands are more overseas. We are currently in talks with Singapore for this. Moreover, we also aim to expand our experiential learning programmes in various institutions (both educational and corporate). What are the social objectives of your entrepreneurial venture? How do you envisage making a positive impact on the ecosystem in which your enterprise is operating?Our main goal is to uplift the local community and train them to be employed. We aim to change the way people travel by giving them alternate facilities like pre-guide booking for an immersive experience, switching from hotels to locally owned homestays, exploring lesser known trails, enjoying the culture and eating locally made food with the local people rather than dining in fancy restaurants. We do not allow the participants in our experiential learning programmes to bring plastics and we also run cleanliness drives. As I said earlier we have already trained 80 plus guides and impacted 200 plus families whose regular income depends on us. Within 3 years, we plan to train and onboard 2000 plus guides and connect local and remote homestays in our app to make them available to the travelling community. How important is training and mentoring for an entrepreneur? Which are the organisations that are building entrepreneurs in our state ? Any other facilitating factors that are needed? A Mentor is like KRISHNA to ARJUN for the founder. More than funding, mentors are important because they share knowledge through their experience. With all the advice and guidance, you can avoid making mistakes and gain traction on the route to your goals. A mentor also helps you to build and grow a robust network. The mentor is the person who will objectively criticise you on your face so that you can correct your mistakes and be focussed. Organisations like Assam Start-up and Downtown venture lab are giving the best opportunities in this case. There are also other educational institutions who have established entrepreneurship cells to inspire young aspirants in this field. How did you go about looking for an investor or seed funding? What are some of the standard criteria that they look for in an entrepreneurial venture? Networking is one of the gold mines where you can find not only investors, but mentors, co-founders and dedicated employees as well. There are many platforms where you can do networking and one of the gold mines is LinkedIn. I must say that we observed that students in this part of the country are not taught to build resumes or portfolios. They don't even know what LinkedIn is and it's actually a shame. Other than that, there are tons of events organised all across the globe where you can pitch to get investors, incubation and mentoring. All these information is found in LinkedIn only. We at least felt this way because we were able to connect with our mentor, investor and media houses through LinkedIn. Some things that an investor considers in terms of the venture or the founder include the following: • The product and its innovation. • The potential of the idea. • The market size where you will be launching it. • The team that is working to make it big. • The leadership and dedication of the founders. • Financials. How much do you credit technology for the success of your business? Can you please share your views? Technology has a huge impact on us in terms of scaling up our business as well as visibility. Our entire system depends on technology. Previously, we were doing business in a traditional way and providing good services. However, we were not able to maintain many things such as guide verifications and availability, safety confirmations etc. With technology all our activities have got swifter and we are able to manage everything smoothly and now growing the company to the next level. It shall not be an exaggeration to say that it is only because of technology that we are able to bring this new revolution in the travel industry. This is not to discount the help and support that we had from other crucial quarters.Also Read: The Jinx of AmolaAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/a-startup-that-is-changing-the-paradigm-of-travel/","tags":["Life,Melange,Supplements,More"],"title":"A Startup that is Changing the Paradigm of Travel"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Vaastu Rules for Windows and Staircases The number of windows in a house should always be even like 4, 6, 8, 10 etc. Double paneled windows are more auspicious than single paneled ones. Windows should open towards the inside.\nMany people are of the opinion that vaastu is not applicable to apartments and flats. However, this is not true and the effects of vaastu are the same for all kinds of constructions/buildings. Since unlike independent houses, apartments do not have open areas, the windows play a great role. They are the entry points for air, light and energy. So it is important to have windows in proper places adhering to vaastu rules.Windows at the South and West If you require windows at the South and West, have small windows. However, if there are already open spaces at the South and West, windows should be avoided as far as possible. The Northeast and East The Northeast and East should have bigger windows. This will allow more sunlight and air into the house resulting in more positive energy. The Number of Windows The number of windows in a house should always be even like 4, 6, 8, 10 etc. Double paneled windows are more auspicious than single paneled ones. Windows should open towards the inside. This allows energy to come inside. Avoid windows at the Southwest just like doors. Staircase RulesThis is one area which is neglected by many. A staircase built in the wrong direction and in defiance (opposition) of vaastu norms can upset the vaastu of the entire house/building. The staircase is considered the secondary gateway of pranic energy to the upper floors. The Southwest should be kept heavy at all times. Therefore a staircase at the Southwest is considered the best. West and South are also good directions for building a staircase. Under NO circumstances, should a staircase be built at the Northeast as doing this will lead to a blockade of the Northeast. Southeast is also not bad to have the staircase but there may be some other problems associated with this direction. An external staircase can be built in the South-east facing the East, South-west facing the West, Northwest facing the North and Southwest facing the South. The staircase should always have an odd number of stairs and the number must never end with a zero i.e. 10, 20 etc. While climbing the stairs, the face of the person MUST face the South or West. A spiral staircase is not advisable as it is believed to cause bad health. Moreover a staircase encircling the building should be avoided as this is believed to cause calamites. A room having a staircase in the Southwest corner of a basement is not auspicious. It is advisable to have doors at the end and beginning of a staircase. The staircase should NOT be built in the centre or Brahmasthan of the house. This will pose all sorts of problems for the residents. A staircase should not be visible to visitors. Broken stairs must be repaired immediately. The space below the staircase should be left vacant. This will help the education of students. Toilet should NOT be built under the staircase. Kitchen, store room or Puja rooms are forbidden under the staircase. Use of Aparajita (Blue pea/Butterfly pea) flower in vaastu The Blue Aparajita is also known as Blue pea or Butterfly pea (pigeonwings).In vaastu shastra, this flower has a big role. The Aparajita is mainly found in white and blue colours. The blue variety is liked by Lord Vishnu. So it is also known as Krishnakanta or Vishnukanta. Financial growth of a household increases with the growth of the blue Aparajita. This flower is capable of bringing peace and happiness.Benefits of Blue Aparajita: 1. Negative energy is expelled and positive energy multiplies with Blue Aparajita. 2. Since Lord Vishnu likes this flower, Aparajita is also considered to be a favourite flower of Goddess Lakshmi. It is believed that this flower attracts riches and ushers rewards of hard work. 3. It is believed that by planting the Blue Aparajita, the intellectual ability of people increases. The members of a house are never at a loss if they offer this flower to Lord Vishnu regularly. 4. Blue is the colour of Lord Shani (Saturn). It is believed that if the Blue Aparajita is offered to Shanidev, he will be pleased and will free the giver from all ill and malefic effects of Saturn. The direction of growing and keeping the Blue Aparajita: The north is the best direction to keep this plant because the North is ruled by Goddess Lakshmi as well as Lord Kuber. It should not be planted at the South or West. Some people are of the opinion that since blue is Shani's favourite colour; this flower should be kept at the West. However, it is not so. Some Vaastu Tips For Keeping Cash 1. Keep the area neat and clean where you keep cash. 2. Keep a silver coin with Goddess Lakshmi in your safe or cash box. 3. Never keep your money in your cash box with important files and documents. 4. Never leave your cash box empty. Always make sure that there is at least a one-rupee coin in it. 5. DO NOT keep your safe or cash box in the last or first room of your house. 6. Don't place your cash box near a window or ventilator. This is also common sense against easy theft. 7. Keep your valuables in a place (which is well lit and has positive energy) on a Thursday. 8. Keep 11 Gomti chakras wrapped in yellow cloth in the cash box Reader queries My house has a verandah at the East extending from Northeast to Southeast. I need to have a room for my maid. Where can I construct the room by using the verandah? P Lyngdoh, Shillong. The Southeast is the best portion to build this room. DO NOT construct it at the Northeast or East. I have an open car shed at the Northeast with a tinned roof touching my house. I am constructing a new car shed at the Northwest as suggested by you. Can I convert the old car shed into a store? Ashok Das, Lakhimpur A big NO!! Store room at Northeast will affect your finances and arrest growth.

And a lot of people were not happy. The blowback was so intense that Apple had to release a special tool to remove it. And it was all Bono’s fault, as he explained in an interview with The Guardian over the weekend.When Bono approached Tim Cook, along with Eddy Cue and Phil Schiller about the idea, he was met with some incredulity. \"Are you talking about free music?\" Cook said.In Bono’s words: \"'No,' I said, 'I don’t think we give it away free. I think you pay us for it and then you give it away free, as a gift to people.'\" Cook was apparently not convinced, asking if it would be distributed only to U2 fans, and the singer replied: “I think we should give it away to everybody.” No, Bono, no!– Mat SmithThe Morning After isn’t just a newsletter – it’s also a daily podcast.

If you are feeling a bit drained or pressured, find someone you care about and give them an all-enveloping hug. Because research has found that embracing reduces the amount of cortisol (stress hormone) in our bodies, releasing tension and sending calming messages to the brainSince decades, medical practitioners and wellness experts have acknowledged the importance of physical touch in terms of a human being's overall psychological and even biological wellbeing. Hugging probably tops the range of physical expressions that facilitate and accelerate this wellbeing. Hugging can be described as a handshake from the heart. The simple action of embracing creates feel-good energy for both the giver and recipient. Science has been looking into its positive effects, and numerous studies related to hugging, cuddling and touching have been reaching the same conclusion—hugging is a crucial part of human development. According to psychologists human beings are in need of at least eight hugs or more a day. Talking about some specific benefits of hugging, Neetu Goswami a Guwahati based psychiatrist says, \"Hugging is simply healthy for the heart. Embracing activates the hormone oxytocin, which makes us feel good. In my experience as a psychiatrist I have actually observed that most depression patients do not have regular physical intimacy (by way of hugs and kisses) with their family or friends.\" Hugging also reduces stress naturally. \"If you are feeling a bit drained or pressured, find someone you care about and give them an all-enveloping hug. Because research has found that embracing reduces the amount of cortisol (stress hormone) in our bodies, releasing tension and sending calming messages to the brain,\" explains Goswami. Touch is critical to infants, especially in their early stages of life as it helps them bond with others as they get older. Hugging is important for adults, too. Physical touch and hugging can combat feelings of loneliness that arise as people get older. Informing about another benefit of hugging, Goswami says hugging can make you a more mindful and present person. According to him hugging can also minimize fears. \"A recent study (conducted in US) on fears and self-esteem looked into the connection between human touch and reducing the fear of mortality. Participants were more likely to have less anxiety towards death when being lightly touched or hugging an inanimate object like a teddy bear,\" he shares. Overall hugging for longer periods of time is better for the body. \"When people hug for 20 seconds or more, the feel-good hormone oxytocin is released which creates a stronger bond and connection between the huggers. Oxytocin has been shown to boost the immune system and reduce stress,\" sums Dr Goswami. There are some cultures that are more receptive to hugging as a social phenomenon. Dr Goswami says that although there are no definite studies to prove it, people hailing from such communities also tend to live longer.Also Read: About a Winter Night's MirageAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/hug-your-way-to-a-healthy-and-happy-life/","tags":["Life,Melange,Supplements,More"],"title":"Hug your Way to a Healthy and Happy Life"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Video: PM Modi sings \u0026lsquo;Maa Tujhe Salaam\u0026rsquo; along with soliders at Kargil on Diwali- WATCH He also laid a wreath at the Kargil War Memorial and paid tribute to the army personnel who lost their lives here in 1999.

The 18th match of the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup between South Africa and Zimbabwe has been reduced to a nine-over contest due to inclement weather conditions in Hobart. Although the 17th match between Netherlands and Bangladesh in the afternoon didn’t witness any weather interruption at the same venue, the start of this match got delayed by over a couple of hours. Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine won the toss and chose to bat in anticipation of a 20-over innings but had to walk out to bat alongside wicket-keeper batter Regis Chakabva knowing that he would have to accelerate from the word go. Aakash Chopra propounds rule change in T20 World Cup points system Former India batter Aakash Chopra, who is part of Star Sports Network’s Hindi commentary roaster for this World Cup, took to social media platform Twitter to propound a rule change with respect to the points system. Chopra, 45, suggested that ICC (International Cricket Council) should initiate bonus points in T20 World Cups. Chopra’s thought behind saying so was inspired particularly from matches which get abandoned due to rain. In the general run of things, both teams share a point each in abandoned matches. However, the nature of the beast is such that losing a point to rain has it in it to affect a team’s probability of qualifying for the next round, i.e., semi-finals. We must have a Bonus Point in the #T20WorldCup No team can afford a rained out game…Bonus point, at least, allows you a serious chance of making up for a lost point. — Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) October 24, 2022 Although the weather will always remain an uncontrollable factor in sport, bonus points would give teams opportunities of making up for lost points due to poor weather. For the unversed, a bonus points is generally awarded for a team winning a match by a gargantuan margin (like 10 wickets or a certain number of runs). Other than the bonus point, former India pacer Ajit Agarkar also put forward a clause regarding teams getting to change their Playing XIs before the start of a rain-affected match such as the one being played at the Blundstone Arena. Agarkar’s rationale behind the same was teams’ strategies having it in them to get changed in such a shortened contest.

How to use the World Clock World Clocks allow you to see different time zones from different regions around the world all in one area. You can add as many clocks as you would like. How to add a clock to the tab in macOS Ventura Select the World Clock tab Tap the Plus icon in the upper right of the screen A search box will appear. Type in the area and/or zone you want to know the time from Once you select the place you have searched, it will show up in the World Clocks tab with a clock telling its time To delete a clock, just hover your cursor over the clock and an \"X\" will appear in the upper left. Click on it to delete it. How to use Alarm on macOS Ventura Alarms allow you to select an important time that you want your Mac to alert you. Adding an Alarm is very similar on macOS as it is on iOS . Open the Clock App Navigate to the Alarm tab Click on the Plus icon in the upper right Click on the hour or minute to change the time Type in what time you want the alarm to go off Select if it is in the AM or PM If you want the alarm to repeat itself , click on what days you would like the alarm to go off Name the alarm next to the section titled \"Label\" Select what sound you would like to sound when the alarm goes off The checkbox next to \"Snooze\" will automatically be selected, but unselect it if you do not want a Snooze option to be present when the alarm goes off Select \"Save\" to implement the alarm or \"Cancel\" to forfeit the creation Once the alarm is saved, if you want to edit it later, you can click on the alarm you want to edit and it will bring you into the settings from before when setting up the alarm. To delete an alarm, hover your cursor over it and an \"X\" will appear. Click on it to delete the alarm. Alarms are not synced between devices, so if you create one on your Mac, it will not show up on your iPhone and/or iPad. How to use the Stopwatch in macOS Ventura The Stopwatch allows you to record time for certain events or activities. When going into the Stopwatch tab, you can click on Start to begin the Stopwatch. Click on Stop to end it. Clicking on Lap while the Stopwatch is running will record specific times that you find important and want to look back at when finishing the Stopwatch. Click Reset to wipe the Stopwatch time and start over. The Stopwatch on macOS works very similarly to how it does on iOS and iPadOS . How to use Timer in macOS Ventura The Timer allows you to set a specific amount of time that you want to be notified. Here is how to set a Timer in macOS. Click on the Timer tab Click on the hours, minutes, or second to change how much you want to add to the timer Select the sound you want to be played once the timer goes off Select Start once everything is to your liking There are multiple ways to end a timer. Here are the options on how to stop them. You can swipe the notification away to end it You can press the X on the notification Click on Options in the notification. Select Stop to stop the timer. Select Repeat to start the timer over. Click on Done in the Timer tab to cancel the timer You can set as many timers as you want when creating them. They can also be edited at any time after creation. What Siri can do with the Clock app in macOS Ventura Performing voice commands to Siri on the Mac works the same as it would on the iPhone or iPad with the Clock app. To activate Siri, you can use \"Hey Siri\" - if you have it enabled, click on the Siri icon next to the time in the toolbar, or hold the microphone icon above the 5 and 6 keys on the keyboard (you can find what the Siri keyboard shortcut is in your Siri settings). Siri can, for now, set alarms and start timers. Ask Siri to set an alarm for a specific time and she will set it, with a preview of the alarm will appear under her response. You can turn the alarm on or off from her response. The alarm will also be located in the Clock app — with the other alarms — where you can edit and delete it if you want to. Ask Siri to start a timer for a specific amount of time and it will start it. A preview of the timer will show under her response. The timer will be in the Clock app once set. You can edit, check, or cancel it from within the app. Siri can also tell you the time in different zones. Just say \"What time is it in London?\" (for example), or another location, and Siri will tell you. Keep track of time The Clock app in macOS Ventura works fairly similar to the application on the iOS and iPadOS platforms. The functions it performs are nearly identical. Adding world clocks, setting alarms and timers, and starting a stopwatch are easy to understand how to do on the Mac when first using it. To make it easier, Siri can also perform some of those tasks - like setting a timer or an alarm - as well.

Did you know that you can use the Pixel Watch charger to top up the Pixel Buds or Pixel Buds Pro? Yes, it actually works. Wireless charging comes in a number of guises, and while the Pixel Watch uses a form of wire-free charging, it only works with the in-the-box magnetic charging puck . In complete contrast, the 2020 Pixel Buds and Pixel Buds Pro can be topped up using reverse wireless charging on your phone and just about any Qi wireless charging dock or station. Interestingly, the Pixel Watch charger is also capable of topping up the Pixel Buds and Buds Pro too. Nowhere in Google’s marketing materials or spec sheets is this listed. It’s a little like the lesser-known trick that means you can effectively place the Pixel Buds A-series to any magnetic surface. After visiting my parents, I forgot my regular USB-C charge cable, which was even more annoying when I wound up with a dead pair of Pixel Buds Pro following a train journey. Luckily, I had packed my Pixel Watch charger so I decided to try putting the earbuds on the puck. To my surprise, after a few seconds, the case light powered on to indicate that my earbuds were indeed charging. PSA: You can charge the Pixel Buds with the Pixel Watch charger. pic.twitter.com/1vi8yjyAQZ — Damien Wilde (@iamdamienwilde) October 24, 2022 Given that the Pixel Watch will incorrectly indicate charging on certain Qi pads, I decided to leave my dead Pixel Buds for a little while to see if this was legit. Even after making it home, I thought this could be a fluke. So for the past couple of days, I’ve tested it multiple times. On every occasion, my earbuds and case are taking and holding a charge just fine. Here’s the short story: It turns out that, yes, you can charge the Pixel Buds or Pixel Buds Pro using the Pixel Watch charger. Because the Pixel Watch charger puck is magnetic, it’ll also stick to the back of your earbuds. You may need to adjust slightly, as the concave shape that is designed for the back of the Pixel Watch doesn’t sit perfectly with the Pixel Buds. That said, once placed, the charge light indicator will begin to flash, and, voila, your favorite earbuds are now getting a little bit of extra juice. Obviously, the lack of Qi wireless charging on the Pixel Buds A-series means that you’re out of luck when using the affordable earbuds. However, if you do have the excellent Pixel Buds Pro or the discontinued Pixel Buds (2020) and don’t have a dedicated wireless charger, this is a great dual-purpose alternative.

With a new CPU and Dynamic Island, the iPhone 14 Pro represented a more extensive update. Here, I have laid out my review of the latest iPhone model and what new things it has to offer its audience and fans. Build and Design If you’re upgrading from an older iPhone, the iPhone 14 Pro has a whole new look. But it is the same when compared to the iPhone 13. It has a similar boxy shape with flat sides, which account for an excellent grasp and in-hand feel. Although, if you prefer using your iPhone without a case, keep a wipe handy for those annoying fingerprint marks that you’re absolutely going to get on the back! A slight difference from its predecessor is the back camera module, which bulges out higher than before. This makes it a bit trickier to type when the phone is laid out on a flat surface as it wobbles a bit. Image: Dinesh Sharma/BGR The buttons on iPhone 14 Pro offer a pleasant sensation to touch. There are two speaker grilles at the bottom, and the earpiece at the top also doubles as a speaker. The sound quality from these is loud and crystal clear, with some bass added to it, which can be felt through the frame of the device. The model comes with a pill-shaped camera module with a lens positioned diagonally. The screen now flaunts an interactive surface called the Dynamic Island around what in other models is just a blank cut-out area. I think the Dynamic Island experience is better on the Pro model rather than the Pro Max model since it has a smaller screen, and you can reach the Dynamic Island display comparatively easily. Color possibilities for the iPhone 14 include silver, gold, space Black, and a new deep purple option to choose from. The iPhone 14 has solid build quality. It’s easier to grasp and use than earlier iPhone models. If you dislike the current trend of huge phones, the iPhone 14 Pro will appeal to you because of its ideal size. It’s perfect for people who prefer a sturdy, minimalistic, and compact build for their phones, as I do. Personally, I’m not too fond of large phones. Thus, I think the iPhone 14’s size is ideal. It can easily fit within a pair of pants pockets and is small enough to be operated with one hand throughout the day. Camera Performance Compared to previous models, the experience with the daylight camera has been significantly enhanced, and the colours are much nicer. iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max offer four cameras, three in the back and one in front. The iPhone 14 Pro sports a primary camera with a wide-angle lens, a 3x telephoto, and an ultrawide camera on the back. Like before, there is only one front camera with a 3D ToF scanner for Face ID. This scanner also supports portrait mode and focus. My favourite Camera upgrades: The phone’s camera has a ton of options that may be used to take various types of pictures. Deep Fusion, Portrait mode, Night Mode, and Burst Mode are a few of these characteristics. Every camera supports video capture in 4K at 60fps with expanded dynamic range and cinematic stabilization. All cameras and all shooting modes support Dolby Vision HDR capture. The Cinematic Mode now supports up to 4K HDR recording at 30fps and is compatible with the primary, telephoto, and selfie cameras. New stabilization options include Action mode and Enhanced Stabilization. Image: Dinesh Sharma/BGR The iPhone 14 Pro has several photography enhancements. The phone takes incredibly detailed pictures in good lighting, and the colours are beautifully captured. The ultrawide camera performs admirably and captures even some of the most minor details in far-off structures. Apple has made some software adjustments to enhance the front camera experience too. The iPhone 14 Pro is a significant upgrade for users, so I would vouch for this to be a good iPhone upgrade when considering camera quality. Dynamic Island Let’s talk about one of the most incredible things to come out of this release. Here’s what gives iPhone 14 Pro the edge over its competitors and predecessors. iPhone users can now view a variety of controls and information, including music, timers, ‘Now Playing,’ and system-wide alerts like AirPods connecting. The most recent high-end iPhones introduce a feature called Dynamic Island that creates an entirely new section at the top of the display where system-wide notifications and contextual information now appear at the top instead of obscuring other iOS components. Image: Dinesh Sharma/BGR With Dynamic Island, iPhone users now have the option to multitask and view all ongoing activities. Users can gather all of their actions in one location rather than browsing apps one at a time. Dynamic Island can follow live activities like Map directions, check their notifications, manage AirDrop connections, set a timer, manage AirDrop connections, and play music. Display Along with Dynamic Island, another thing that sets iPhone 14 Pro apart from its predecessors is its display screen. The 14 Pro has a brighter, more vibrant display that performs amazingly even in outdoor settings. This is because of its 6.1-inch OLED Super Retina XDR ProMotion screen sporting a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. This display changes its refresh rate to adapt to what you’re doing. The advanced display hardware also supports AOD (Always-on Display) mode to make the phone look alive even when you’re not using it. Under any lighting situation, the iPhone 14 Pro provides an excellent viewing experience. I discovered that a brightness level of about 50% was sufficient indoors. Since most of my time is spent indoors, I was pleasantly surprised by the fantastic screen performance under low lighting conditions. Image: Dinesh Sharma/BGR Battery Life It is impossible to ignore the fact that iPhones have had a long history of battery issues. I cannot deny how disappointing the older models were in terms of their battery life when compared to androids. But the good side of it relies on the fact that Apple can bring in considerable changes to the battery’s shelf life, as seen in the latest models like the 13 Pro series. I believe the battery life has improved even more with the iPhone 14 Pro. According to Apple, the 3,200mAh battery inside the iPhone 14 Pro can support 23 hours of movie playback. I used the phone to play mobile games, scroll across applications, mainly Instagram and WhatsApp, and binge-watch YouTube or any TV series, and I found myself with a phone that lasted for about 15 hours of screen time. The new iPhone 14 has Pro MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W, much as the iPhone 13. Once more, the packaging contains no charging adapter. There is a USB-C to lightning cable in the retail packaging. Software Performance If you’re upgrading from an earlier iPhone, the performance of the iPhone 14 Pro is another significant improvement. The phone flaunts a 4nm A16 Bionic chipset, 6 core CPU with 2 performance and 4 efficiency cores, 5 core GPU, and 16 core Neural Engine with IOS 16. The A16 Bionic chipset’s energy conservation and, of course, the AI engines that make things like AR features and power management possible are its finest qualities. Another potential upgrade for Apple users is the 6GB RAM as compared to the 4GB in the iPhone 13. This makes the iPhone 14 Pro probably the fastest smartphone on the market today! There are several apparent benefits of iOS 16, which is the default operating system for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The lock screen can be personalized with widgets, images, and other features. Other prominent characteristics include the restoration of the battery percentage display and the option to edit and unsend texts. Image: Dinesh Sharma/BGR The A16 is a powerful chip that performs multitasking, gaming, and all other tasks performed on the iPhone admirably. Therefore, using the iPhone 14 Pro won’t present any performance concerns for you. I did a lot of browsing on the iPhone 14 Pro, checking and responding to emails, and doing a lot more. The phone effectively handles everything. One of the nicest features is that the iPhone 14 Pro never gets warm even after being put through a lot of use, not even while it is charging. Price The base 128GB variant of the iPhone 14 Pro has a starting price of ₹129900.00 in India. Three more options are available: 256GB for ₹139900.00, 512GB for Rs ₹159900.00, and 1TB for 179900.00. Final Verdict: Is it worth it? We all know that the newest iPhone is always the most desirable one. It seems like every year, when a new iPhone model is released, people rush to their nearest Apple Store to get their hands on it. The question that often comes to mind is: are they really worth the money? Well, if you’re looking for a quick answer, then yes, the iPhone 14 Pro is definitely worth it! Especially people who still use older iPhone models, such as the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR, should absolutely upgrade to the iPhone 14 Pro. For users of the year-old iPhone 13, there might not be a drastic upgrade in the new model, but with the introduction of Dynamic Island and improvements like RAM, battery life, and camera performance, the iPhone 14 Pro is definitely worth investing in for the long run if you want to ride with the trends and enjoy a smooth functioning phone with a quality build.

The project to create a youth scientific laboratory of ice engineering was developed at the Amur State University named after Sholom Aleichem. The rector of the university, Natalia Bazhenova, speaking at the defense of the draft program for its development, said that both the scientific and educational fields would be concentrated around such a laboratory, the training programs for masters and graduate students would be reformatted, and a cohort of young scientists would be formed. The scientific results of the laboratory of ice engineering are directly related to the needs of the Jewish Autonomous Region. We are talking about the development of new effective methods for the destruction of the ice cover during the elimination of congestion on rivers during periods of freeze-up and ice drift, as well as the extension of the navigation of freezing rivers and reservoirs. New devices can be designed to clear roads from snow, remove ice from contact networks and power lines, EAOMedia news agency writes with reference to Bazhenova. As for the target model for the development of PSU named after Sholom Aleichem, by 2030 it should become a center for generating unique opportunities for the development of the human and socio-economic potential of the Far East region. The strategic project entitled “Live, study and work in the Far East” consists of the scientific project “ProNauku” and projects aimed at implementing policies within the framework of the university development program. Earlier it was reported that a study was carried out on the territory of the JAO on how reinforced ice behaves at crossings. They will be dealt with by the scientist Alexei Vasiliev, who received a grant of 300,000 rubles for this purpose as part of the governor’s competition.\nthenewsglory\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/ice-engineering-laboratory-to-be-created-in-the-jewish-autonomous-region/","tags":["World"],"title":"Ice engineering laboratory to be created in the Jewish Autonomous Region"},{"categories":["world"],"contents":"Tomorrow almost a quarter of the sun will be eclipsed: ‘Pretty good chance of good visibility’ There is a good chance that we will be able to see part of the solar eclipse tomorrow in the Netherlands.

That is according to Weeronline, which predicts that there will also be moments with clearings around midday between the thin cloud veils. At its peak, the sun is 22 percent shielded. The solar eclipse begins Tuesday morning at 11:08 a.m. Around noon, at 12.05 sharp, it is at its peak and almost a quarter of the sun in the Netherlands is covered by the moon. Then it seems as if a bite has been taken out of the sun. At 1:03 p.m., the moon has completely moved away from the sun. The weather will be much better than today, which will increase the chance of a good view of the solar eclipse. In the west of the country there may still be some rain, in the rest of the country it will remain as good as dry, according to Weeronline. There are some high, thin clouds, with blue skies in between. “This makes it quite likely to get a good view of the sun for some time around noon,” says Roosmarijn Knol of Weeronline. Tuesday’s solar eclipse minute by minute. © Weerplaza Need Eclipse Glasses If you want to view the eclipse safely, you must use special eclipse glasses. Staring directly at the sun, even during a darkening, causes eye damage. Damage to the retina can even lead to blindness. The eclipse glasses are made of a special foil that filters the sunlight and allows you to look directly at the sun for up to thirty seconds. The glasses are for sale online or at the optician. Nowhere 100 percent dark Often when there is a partial solar eclipse in the Netherlands, the moon moves completely in front of the sun elsewhere in the world. But not this year. In parts of Russia, the sun is more than half covered, with 82 percent in the best spot. So it gets very dark there. On the map below you can see how dark it gets. The eclipse can only be seen over parts of Africa, the Middle East, Asia and especially Europe. The sun is nowhere in the world completely eclipsed. The solar eclipse is greatest in part of Russia, with a maximum of 82 percent. © Weerplaza Did you miss a solar eclipse? If it is too cloudy, or you miss the solar eclipse for some other reason, you don’t have to mourn very long. In 2.5 years, the next one will be on March 29, 2025.

Usually, it's what to have for breakfast. And believe me when I say that this is one of the best decisions you can make for the entire day. Because after fasting for an average of 6-8 hours while you sleep, breaking the fast is imperative to have the energy to begin the day right. A healthy and fulfilling breakfast is the fuel that replenishes your body energy with nutrients and minerals offering you the necessary boost to get back to work. Here's a closer look at why you should make it a point to make the first meal of the day a priority, without exception: If you are keen about losing excess weight, it's a cardinal dietary sin to skip breakfast regularly. The habit of consuming power-packed, wholesome breakfasts shortly after waking up helps to curb your hunger pangs throughout the day. This further leads to less chances of overeating and helps you consciously make nutritious choices when it comes to your other meals. So, if you are keeping tabs on your weight, a nutritious breakfast is not an option, it IS the only option to keep obesity at bay. A healthy breakfast not only kick starts your day and keeps your health in check but also decreases the risk of contracting heart disease in the long run. Studies have linked breakfast skippers to increased chances of clogged arteries. That also opens the door to other lifestyle diseases such as high cholesterol, hypertension, obesity, and many more, which leads to higher risk of strokes and heart attacks. Studies have also proven that having breakfast reduces the chances of getting Diabetes since it minimises the insulin spikes in your blood and keeps insulin resistance at bay. On the other hand, missing breakfast habitually can be correlated to developing Type 2 Diabetes caused by persistent insulin resistance. By skipping breakfast, you allow your body's insulin levels to drop and spike again sharply post lunch -- the most foolproof way to getting Type 2 Diabetes. If you eat breakfast regularly, you are giving your brain a necessary boost and thus are mentally sharper to those who skip it. You will notice that your short-term memory is enhanced, equipping you with increased concentration and productivity levels. Whenever you skip breakfast, you invariably begin to feel hungry later and be drawn to junk food frequently than you would have if you had eaten a healthy breakfast. This is a direct result of the decision fatigue, comes from being hungry and low on energy. Hence, always eat a hearty breakfast to keep your blood sugar, insulin, and energy levels stable in the best way. Since eating breakfast restores your body's glucose levels, it aids brain constant functioning throughout the day. This way, by making it a habit of eating breakfast on time regularly, you also boost your metabolism in the correct fashion. By having a nutritious breakfast daily, you also tend to meet your body's daily dose of required vital nutrients, vitamins, and minerals as compared to people who tend to skip having breakfast. If you include protein, whole grains, unpolished pulses, low-fat dairy and tons of fresh fruits and vegetables in your breakfast, you are all set for a great day ahead. It is not for nothing that breakfast is considered as most important meal of the day. Anybody who is serious about sustaining good health, maintaining an optimal body weight, keeping most chronic lifestyle diseases at bay must make it a mandatory part of their daily routine to take time out every morning and have a hearty, wholesome breakfast soon after waking up. Skipping it is not an option! (Amarnath Halember, Executive Director and CEO, NextG Apex India Pvt.

The new study led by the University of Waterloo in Canada aimed to investigate the relationship between vaccine hesitancy, psychological factors associated with anxiety, and individuals' reasoning for and against getting the vaccine. \"People with anxiety difficulties were not more hesitant about the vaccine. Rather, the more discomfort they had with uncertainty, the less hesitant they were,\" said Dr Christine Purdon, professor of Clinical Psychology at Waterloo in a paper published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders. \"The opposite was true of those without anxiety, suggesting that discomfort with uncertainty may be an important factor when addressing vaccine hesitancy,\" Purdon added. To conduct the study, the researchers surveyed 148 participants with and without anxiety disorders. All participants completed an online questionnaire examining Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy along with other related variables such as conspiracy beliefs, individualism, and intolerance of uncertainty. They also surveyed the top reasons why individuals were motivated to get the vaccine and the top reasons why they were hesitant. The most common reasons that participants were hesitant to get the vaccine were related to the vaccine's effectiveness and novelty, and fear of adverse effects. In contrast, the most frequent reasons that participants were motivated to get the vaccine were to protect others, to protect self, and to return to a sense of normalcy. The researchers found that anxious and non-anxious participants did not differ in vaccine hesitancy. However, discomfort with uncertainty predicted greater vaccine hesitancy in non-anxious participants, and in both groups' vaccine hesitancy was predicted by individualistic worldviews, conspiracy beliefs, and a lack of trust in authority. Aliya McNeil, lead author of the study, said that the findings could suggest that people without anxiety disorders are concerned with uncertainty related to the vaccine itself, whereas people with anxiety disorders might view the vaccine as an opportunity to reduce stress and uncertainty related to the virus. This may indicate that vaccine hesitancy is related to how one values independence. The researchers hope that their findings will help aid in future research that continues to explore vaccine hesitancy and interventions to promote vaccine uptake.\ntribuneindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/anxiety-disorder-has-no-effect-on-vaccine-hesitancy-study/","tags":[],"title":"Anxiety disorder has no effect on vaccine hesitancy: Study"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Sunrise by window, Sunday brunch with her gang, here\u0026rsquo;s how Malaika Arora celebrated 48th birthday ANI Mumbai, October 24 Actor Malaika Arora turned 49 on Sunday.

Amid huge anticipation, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson starrer Black Adam was released in cinema halls in the country on October 20. The movie has already become Johnson's highest opener till now in the domestic market in the USA and had managed to get a decent opening in India as well. With a four-day weekend at hand, let's see how the latest Hollywood movie performed at the box office on the first weekend in India and how things are looking for it going ahead. Black Adam has been doing good business in Mumbai, Delhi and Southern states. Its collections in the first two days were well over Rs 11 crore. However, the earnings took a hit on Saturday and Sunday because of pre-Diwali festivities and the India Vs Pakistan T20 World Cup match. The film's collections in the northern region have been particularly lower because the Diwali fever is high. However, despite challenges, the film has managed to do business of well over Rs 23 crore in the first four days. Black Adam will be challenged by the Bollywood releases Ram Setu and Thank God from October 25 onwards. The new films have been eyed by the fans for the longest time and given the appeal of lead stars, and Ajay Devgn respectively, and the genre of the films, Black Adam will face stiff competition from October 25 onwards when the latest releases hit the big screens. Black Adam did business of USD 140 million worldwide in the opening weekend. The movie has been getting mixed reviews from critics but Johnson's appeal and the pull for the family audience have been witnessed globally. The movie performed especially well in markets where DC excels, including Latin America and parts of South East Asia, reported Deadline.\nindiatvnews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/black-adam-box-office-dwayne-johnson-starrer-earns-this-much-in-india-in-1/","tags":[],"title":"Black Adam Box Office: Dwayne Johnson starrer earns this much in India in 1st weekend"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Hong Kong Presents Digital Currency Prototype, Project Aurum Financial authorities in Hong Kong have unveiled a prototype of the Chinese autonomous territory’s own central bank digital currency called Project Aurum.

The two-tier platform features a wholesale interbank and a retail e-wallet system, participants revealed. Hong Kong to Issue Retail Tokens and Stablecoins as Part of Project Aurum A collaboration between the BIS Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute has produced a prototype of Hong Kong’s upcoming digital currency, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) announced. Project Aurum is a full-stack, front-end and back-end, central bank digital currency (CBDC) system comprising a wholesale interbank system and a retail e-wallet system, the international financial institution explained in a press release this week. Participants in Aurum want to launch two different types of digital tokens. The first kind will be an intermediated digital currency while the second one will be a CBDC-backed stablecoin circulated in the interbank system. The BIS remarked: The latter is unique in the study of CBDC to date. Privacy, safety and flexibility are core to the system. “Bringing CBDC-backed stablecoins to life has never been done before and we, therefore, felt that doing so may supplement the growing body of research on private sector stablecoins,” the project’s authors elaborate. They further explain that in contrast with private stablecoins, Aurum’s stablecoin balances are reconciled, versus real-time gross settlement balances of the issuing bank with the central bank. The developers believe that the system of CBDC-backed stablecoins can be used by monetary authorities when they try to work out the regulatory approaches in regard to private sector stablecoins, “especially while seeking to design methods to verify the backing of the stablecoins, a highly topical matter.” Just like with its fiat currency, three of Hong Kong’s financial institutions will be authorized to issue state-backed digital coins. Hong Kong, one of the world’s major financial centers, has been intensifying efforts to catch up with others on the CBDC development front, including mainland China which has been expanding the digital yuan (e-CNY) pilot. The Chinese special administrative region started exploring the issuance of its own CBDC in March 2021. In September of this year, the HKMA said that it was preparing to trial a digital version of the Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD) in the coming months. The monetary authority also took part in trials of cross-border CBDC transactions with the People’s Bank of China and the central banks of Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.

(Bloomberg) -- Rishi Sunak took a huge step toward becoming the UK’s next prime minister as former premier Boris Johnson pulled out of the contest after a weekend of vacillation and as he won the endorsement of Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt. In a brief statement on Twitter late Sunday -- shortly after Johnson said he wouldn’t stand for fear of dividing the Conservative Party -- Sunak vowed to lead with “integrity, professionalism and accountability” if he won the race for No. 10 Downing Street. Johnson’s decision, days after he cut short a Caribbean holiday to get his political campaign going, leaves Sunak facing House of Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt in what is now a two-person race. Sunak, a former chancellor whose resignation in July led to Johnson’s ultimate downfall, gained the public support of several key ministers on Sunday including Grant Shapps and -- on the Tory right -- Suella Braverman. Sunak has at least 123 lawmakers behind him, compared to Johnson’s 51 named backers, according to Bloomberg’s tally, which counts only 23 for Mordaunt. In his statement, Johnson said he had the support of at least 102 MPs, enough to have taken the contest to a ballot of party members who have sided with Johnson in the past. The issue now is how many of Johnson’s camp, including Brexit hardliners such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, will throw their lot in with Mordaunt and ensure the race continues beyond Monday. According to odds at political betting site Smarkets, Sunak is a near certainty to become Britain’s fourth prime minister in three years. But whoever wins faces the task of trying to bring unity to a party that has been through months of upheaval and bruising public infighting. Conservative support has fallen well behind the Labour opposition in polls as a brutal cost-of-living squeeze and soaring inflation darkens the economic outlook. The pound extended gains after Johnson said he wouldn’t stand, rallying as much as 1.0% to $1.1401 in Asia on expectations that a potential Sunak premiership would be better qualified at trying to fix the nation’s finances. Sunak will “turn the page on what went wrong, take decisions in the national interest and rebuild the extraordinary potential of our economy,” Hunt said in a column for the Telegraph late Sunday. It was Prime Minister Liz Truss’s decision to step down that triggered the contest, following weeks of turmoil with investors jettisoning UK assets. Her economic plan, including a big boost in borrowing to pay for tax cuts, rattled markets and turned voter sentiment further against the Tories. The possibility that Johnson could return to office after leaving less than two months ago was the latest twist in the upheaval of British politics that followed the 2016 vote to leave the European Union. Johnson, whose ability to cut through to the broad electorate helped the Conservatives to a landslide win in the 2019 general election, had to step down after a series of scandals rocked his premiership. His political career appeared all but over until Truss’s administration imploded. After Mordaunt declared her candidacy on Friday, and Sunak did likewise on Sunday, the pressure was mounting on Johnson’s camp. But after trying to broker deals separately with Sunak and Mordaunt, Johnson realized that even if he did win the support of party members, he’d struggle to run operations from Downing Street with a fractured and rebellious parliamentary party questioning his decisions. While he remains popular with Tory members, MPs are divided about his legacy and worried that returning him to office would revive all the scandals that bought him down. “You can’t govern effectively unless you have a united party in Parliament,” Johnson wrote in his statement. “There is a very good chance that I would be successful in the election with Conservative party members. But in the course of the last days I have sadly come to the conclusion that this would simply not be the right thing to do.” The party set a deadline of 2 p.m. Monday for contenders to certify the support of at least 100 MPs each to go forward to a ballot. If there’s more than one candidate running by the end of Monday, party members will have the final say in an online vote, with a result due on Friday. Johnson didn’t endorse anyone, saying he’d support whoever wins. While Sunak has a commanding lead, his coronation isn’t necessarily clear cut and there are some scenarios where Mordaunt could emerge as the favorite of Tory members. Earlier in the summer, he lost to Truss in the leadership battle to replace Johnson, with Tory members concerned about his role in Johnson’s downfall and his decision to raise taxes to the highest level since World War II. There’s also unease about his personal wealth and his aggressive attacks on Truss during that contest. Mordaunt’s star is rising and she has a more informal tone that jibes better with the electorate than Sunak’s more polished image. She served as trade secretary before being promoted to lead the House of Commons, while her confident performances in the lower house and optimistic outlook generated talk she could help Conservatives move beyond Johnson-Sunak controversies. In the contest that installed Truss as premier, Mordaunt placed second to Sunak -- and ahead of Truss -- in every round of voting among her MP colleagues until the critical one. In July, a ConservativeHome website survey of party members ranked Mordaunt second behind Defense Secretary Ben Wallace on who should be leader. Those factors may encourage Mordaunt’s reluctance to step aside. Growth and Prosperity In a column for the Telegraph newspaper, Mordaunt wrote she’d focus on cutting taxes and raising productivity to “deliver growth and prosperity” across the nation, a pitch similar to what Truss offered. “I understand the challenges families are facing, and I know how difficult things are when household budgets are squeezed, the cost of living goes up and public services just don’t seem to be there,” Mordaunt wrote. But Tory leaders are concerned at the growing economic crisis starting to engulf the country. A closely-watched survey due Monday morning is likely to show a recession is deepening as inflation lingers at its highest level in 40 years. A burgeoning budget deficit has left Hunt warning about difficult decisions ahead. He’s due to deliver a major statement on the Treasury’s tax-and-spending plans on Oct. 31, a date picked to better inform the Bank of England on how quickly it raises interest rates.

The United States (US) has recorded more than 15 million pediatric COVID-19 cases until September 2022, and pediatric patients account for about 18% of US COVID-19 cases. Notably, during the Omicron wave, children younger than six months accounted for 44% of the overall COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among those under four. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been effective, particularly against the Delta variant. However, they were less effective against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron. Since infants younger than six months are ineligible for COVID-19 vaccination, they are reliant on the immunity acquired placentally from their mothers. Nevertheless, vaccination during pregnancy is thought to protect infants against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, recent studies reported that maternal vaccination was linked to a lower risk of infection and hospitalization in infants in their first four and five months. ​​​​​​​ Study: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination and Infant Protection Against SARS-CoV-2 During the First 6 Months of Life . ​​​​​​​Image Credit: Marina Demidiuk / Shutterstock In the present study, researchers assessed the effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy against infection of infants with SARS-CoV-2. The study was conducted on infants born from December 15, 2020, to May 31, 2022, at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated healthcare delivery organization providing comprehensive access to healthcare to members. Infants were excluded if they did not become KPNC members within two months of birth or were born to mothers who 1) did not have primary KPNC facility assignment, 2) were not 16-50 years old, 3) tested SARS-CoV-2-positive before pregnancy, 4) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before pregnancy, 5) were vaccinated before pregnancy, 6) received vaccines other than mRNA vaccines, and 7) were not continuous members of KPNC. The study’s outcomes were the first positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result and hospitalization of infants within six months of life. In addition, electronic health records (EHRs) of mothers were accessed to obtain information on covariates such as age, race/ethnicity, the primary KPNC facility, neighborhood deprivation index (NDI), insurance payor, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), diabetes status, hypertension, and parity. The authors used Cox proportional hazards to compute the hazard ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection between infants born to vaccinated and non-vaccinated mothers. Infants were followed up from birth to their first positive test. Additionally, secondary analyses, implemented as a test-negative design, were conducted by restricting the population to infants tested for SARS-CoV-2 at least once. The researchers identified more than 62,000 infants born at KPNC facilities; after exclusions, 30,288 infants were included for analysis. Most mothers (66.15%) were aged 25 – 35 years and White (37.57%), followed by Asians (27.26), Hispanics (24.45%), and Black (5.16%). Mothers of 19,179 infants (63.32%) were not vaccinated during pregnancy; 3.42% of mothers received one dose of mRNA vaccine, 31.22% received two doses, and 2% received three doses during pregnancy. In the first six months of life, 3.1% of infants tested SARS-CoV-2-positive, and 10 had to hospitalize. The crude incidence of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was lower among infants born to double-vaccinated mothers than those with non-vaccinated mothers during the Delta wave. After adjusting for covariates, maternal vaccination during pregnancy was significantly associated with a lower risk of infants testing positive by 85% and 57% during the first two and six months (of life), respectively. During the Omicron wave, maternal vaccination decreased the risk of infants testing positive by 22% and 12% in the first two and six months, respectively. The overall crude hospitalization rate of infants in their first six months was low for those born to double-vaccinated mothers. Only one infant of a vaccinated mother was hospitalized, while the remaining (hospitalized) infants had non-vaccinated mothers. Secondary analysis indicated that maternal vaccination reduced infant test positivity by 63% and 40% in the first six months of life, during Delta and Omicron waves, respectively. In summary, the researchers observed that two mRNA vaccine doses administered during pregnancy were associated with a reduced risk of infants testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their first six months. Protection declined with the age of infants. Maternal vaccination was less effective during the Omicron period. Although vaccination efficacy against infant hospitalization was not assessed due to the small sample, mothers of nine hospitalized infants were not vaccinated, suggesting that maternal vaccination may protect infants from hospitalization.

According to data from The Office of National Coordinator For Health Information Technology, 76% percent of US providers are using an EHR system since 2014. The report also found that more than 50 million people were enrolled in LEM insurance plans during this period, with many choosing not to hold Medicare or Medicaid benefits because they could purchase private insurance through insurers who took these low-income earners cost-effectively. Digitizing data is the key to more efficient patient treatment. A lot of people are looking at how EHR software can streamline medical practices and cut down on costs, which will ultimately benefit patients as well. What is EHR software? Healthcare providers and patients alike can access all patient information with an electronic health record system. This provides for better quality treatment and instant recall at any time during your day or night if needed. For a better understanding of what EHR software consists of, let’s consider its core features: Health information databases are crucial for making treatment decisions regarding diagnosis, allergies, and more. They store clinical data, such as lab test results or medications, which can be accessed using an electronic format. The result management system allows physicians to quickly access and manage test results, providing unparalleled efficiency for busy practices. The order feature helps to reduce medical errors by providing electronic processing of orders and prescriptions. This patient support feature gives patients access to their health records, which can help them carry out at-home monitoring. Now let’s take a closer look at what advantages EHR systems can provide. Reducing medical errors Medical errors are a severe problem in the United States, and according to Martin Makary and Michael Daniel, there is an annual death toll of more than 250 thousand due to them. Data-driven healthcare is the future of personalized care. EHR software helps doctors make better diagnoses and preventive measures. At the same time, digital records keep track of everything from weight loss plans to cholesterol levels in real time so patients can stay healthier for longer. EHR systems have revolutionized the healthcare industry by eliminating tedious data entry requirements, allowing doctors to spend more time on patient care and accuracy. The use of an electronic health record (EHR) is associated with greater efficiency in diagnosis as it provides reliable access for complete past medical history from one place; this allows practitioners more efficient treatment and better outcomes than those achieved through penmanship notes taken at each visit. Increased quality of care The findings from this survey show that 75% of US doctors believe EHR software has allowed them to provide better patient care. As for the patients, 85 percent think digital records will significantly improve their quality. The use of EHRs can improve the quality and accessibility for patients by providing accurate information about lab results, and insurance coverage and making treatment recommendations accessible. Now let’s look in detail at what exactly an EHR does to achieve better care: With an EHR, doctors are able to quickly and accurately diagnose patients. They have access to patient data and treatments that have been attempted before for accurate diagnoses of what might be wrong with you. With e-prescribing, patients can receive prescriptions in an easy-to-read digital format and avoid the hassle of indecipherable handwriting.EHRs have made it possible for physicians to receive instant notifications about their patients’ test results, which can be crucial in making timely decisions. Patients will also benefit from this service because they’ll never miss another appointment or forget anything important.Computer-aided diagnosis is becoming more and more popular, with software algorithms being used to improve the detection of visual abnormalities like lung nodules or pigmented skin lesions. The power of (big) data With the help of EHRs, physicians can make better treatment decisions. The system brings together all available information on one page – it’s like having your google search bar at home. It’s no surprise that patients are eager to have their data collected so they can receive higher-quality care. Medical technology has evolved, and with it comes more options for how we monitor the health of individuals in order to make better treatment decisions based on what is needed at any given time during an individual’s life cycle – from newborns right up until death itself. The powerful advantages of EHR predictive analytics are demonstrated in the case study at Kaiser Permanente. Their own algorithm helped them precisely predict which newborns would need treatment for infection, and they were able to save 250K babies from unnecessary antibiotics by using this information. As we can see from these examples (and many more), successful use cases such as those featured here provide compelling proof that AI is not only possible but necessary when solving problems with high stakes environments like healthcare or law enforcement- where lives depend on accurate outcomes; If you’re looking into implementing any form of machine learning within your team’s workflow – do some research first. Streamlined workflow The implementation of an EHR system has been shown to improve patient care and speed up documentation processes. One healthcare provider who successfully implemented this software saw their speeds for processing paperwork increase by nearly 17%. The full potential of EHR solutions is only unlocked when healthcare providers take advantage and leverage their investments in the technology With EHR, medical staff can focus on what they do best. Paperwork is avoided and all costs of transcription are eliminated by using an electronic health record which saves time for doctors’ offices as well.With EHR solutions, doctors can create notes twice as fast by using templates. For instance, when a patient fully recovers from an illness or injury and their condition is stable enough for them not to need further care in the hospital room – which means less time spent dealing with charts and paperwork on top of everything else- medical staff will be able to save themselves hours every day.With EHR software, doctors can communicate with one another about a patient’s care and share information. Thanks to the robust coordination of treatment plans by medical staff members this will eliminate unnecessary treatments as well as remove some burden from them.With EHR, medical providers can easily find comprehensive files containing all patient treatment data. This is beneficial for both the provider and patient as it enables them to have access not only their current care but also any past treatments they may need in order to get better faster. The future of healthcare may be in EHR software, which can help providers save money and improve patient care by automating basic tasks. This technology also has many other benefits for doctors’ offices including increased revenue due to reduced risk factors associated with medical mistakes.

Study: Impact of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 and its variant polymorphisms on host responses and viral pathogenesis . Image Credit: ktsdesign / Shutterstock The host's innate immune response is the first line of defense against all pathogenic infections. Several studies have highlighted the importance of type I interferon (IFN) response in defending against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Any congenital disorder affecting the IFN pathway makes one susceptible to lethal pathogenic infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Perhaps, this is why some severely ill COVID-19 patients have neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFN. While the determinants for COVID-19 outcome are not understood completely, the inability to mount a timely and effective antiviral IFN response promotes SARS-CoV-2 persistence and tissue damage, contributing to COVID-19 severity. In addition, studies have also shown the role of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins in inhibiting innate immune activation. The researchers of the current study, thus, focused on SARS-CoV-2 ORF6, an accessory SARS-CoV-2 protein. In the present study, researchers used biochemical and molecular methods, combined with in vivo animal studies, to dissect the impact of the innate immune antagonist ORF6 on the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, they functionally characterized the ORF6 D61L mutation common between Omicron BA.2 and BA.4 sub-variants. The team first transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 and an empty vector. Next, they checked for the intracellular distribution of bulk poly (A) RNA levels by fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH). This helped the researchers evaluate whether the ORF6-Nup98/Rae1 interaction could contribute to the inhibition of host mRNA nuclear export. Further, the researchers hypothesized that ORF6 could modulate SARS-CoV-2 gene expression. So they first quantified the differences in protein levels between rSARS-CoV-2 wild-type and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 ∆ORF6 infected cells using global abundance proteomics. Furthermore, they investigated whether ORF6 modulated this protein expression at a transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. For in vivo studies, the team infected eight-week-old female hamsters with 5x10 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of either the parental rSARS-CoV-2 WT or the ORF6-deficient virus. They recorded weight loss in all animals from the day of infection to 15 days post-infection (dpi). Then, they sacrificed these animals at 2, 4, and 6 dpi to harvest their lungs and nasal turbinates to determine viral titer and histopathological evaluations. ORF6 directly interacts with the nucleoporin 98 (Nup98)-ribonucleic acid export 1 (Rae1) complex at the nuclear pore, disrupting bidirectional nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking in two distinct ways. The first method involved selective inhibition of karyopherin-mediated nuclear import pathways, including signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2 by ORF6. Additionally, it prevented nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) p65. The second method involved modulation of host cell messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) export, where ORF6 facilitated the preferential translation of SARS-CoV-2 viral transcripts and prevented host antiviral responses. The D61 residue in the ORF is located close to the M58 residue at the C-terminal tail (CTT) of the protein that directly binds to the RNA binding pocket of the Nup98-Rae1 complex. This mutation, shared by the Omicron variants BA.2 and BA.4, influenced ORF6's ability to block host mRNA export. This phenomenon has important implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and pathogenicity. Furthermore, the authors noted that SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) inhibited host mRNA export. A better understanding of how ORF6 and NSP1 complement each other functionally during SARS-CoV-2 infection will be crucial to uncover molecular mechanisms governing the innate immune antagonism of these viral proteins. Regarding in vivo effects of ORF6, the authors noted that hamsters infected with an ORF6 deleted SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses suffered minimal weight loss and reduced lung injury and type 2 alveolar (AT2) cells' hyperplasia. These findings pointed to an increased STAT1 translocation and interferon-stimulating genes (ISG) expression in the lungs. Surprisingly, this did not markedly reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in the respiratory tract of infected hamsters. One explanation is that this experimental model could not detect the in vivo impact of ORF6 on SARS-CoV-2 replication, which was inherently subtle. It might also be due to the circulation and transmission of Omicron BA.2 and BA.4 variants containing a deleterious ORF6 polymorphism in humans. The study results also uncovered a previously unobserved role of ORF6 in the modulation of SARS-CoV-2 protein expression. The researchers observed that the expression of several ORF1- and subgenomic RNA-derived SARS-CoV-2 proteins were altered in cells infected with an ORF6-deficient SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to favor the expression of structural and accessory viral genes. The study results identified ORF6 as a key SARS-CoV-2 innate immune antagonist. The ORF6 loss-of-function mutations markedly attenuated the host antiviral responses to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo in the hamster model. Furthermore, the study highlighted the importance of genomic surveillance and variant analysis to understand the mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion strategies. bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.\nnews-medical\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/research-suggests-that-orf6-is-a-major-sars-cov-2-innate-immune-antagonist/","tags":[],"title":"Research suggests that ORF6 is a major SARS-CoV-2 innate immune antagonist"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"United Nations Day: आज है यूनाइटेड नेशंस डे, जानें क्या है इस बार की थीम और इसकी हिस्ट्री United Nations day-October 24- हर साल 24 अक्टूबर को यूनाइटेड नेशंस डे मनाया जाता है और इस दिन ही यूनाइटेड नेशन को ऑफिशियल रूप से स्थापित किया गया था. 2022 में यूनाइटेड नेशन को काम करते हुए पूरे 77 साल पूरे हो जाएंगे.\nhindinews18\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/united-nations-day-/","tags":["लाइफ़"],"title":"United Nations Day: आज है यूनाइटेड नेशंस डे, जानें क्या है इस बार की थीम और इसकी हिस्ट्री"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Coimbatore cylinder blast' shows state intelligence failure: TN BJP chief Questioning the DMK govt for state intelligence failure as Coimbatore Cylinder blast, Tamil Nadu BJP President K Annamalai claimed that it was a terror attack with ISIS link\nQuestioning the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government for state intelligence failure as Coimbatore Cylinder blast, Tamil Nadu Bharatiya Janata Party President K Annamalai claimed that it was a terror attack with ISIS link.

In a dig, Thackeray said there is a downpour of announcements under the Eknath Shinde government and a \"drought\" in their implementation as he interacted with rain-hit farmers in Aurangabad district. He said the incumbent government loved to organise celebrations without bothering to see if people are happy and satisfied. The former chief minister was talking to reporters after visiting Pandharpur and Dahegaon villages in the Aurangabad district where retreating rain damaged crops. \"This state government is a celebration-loving government. There is an excess downpour of the announcement, whereas there is a drought in their implementation. Events should be celebrated but the government should see the people in the state are at least satisfied,\" he said. Thackeray said the state government must take efforts to change the relief criteria set by the National Disaster Response Fund as they have become outdated. He also said the state government should follow up with the Centre on the implementation of the 'Beed pattern' of crop insurance, also called the 80-110 formula. According to the supporters of the \"Beed pattern\", the formula gives benefits to farmers and the state by way of excess funds and to the insurer by capping the pay-outs. Calling his visit a symbolic one, Thackeray said the state government must declare \"wet drought\" in the state and provide Rs 50,000 per hectare as compensation to farmers affected by the rains. He said the state government must begin providing relief immediately instead of waiting for the loss assessment reports to be submitted from all areas. Speaking to PTI, farmer Kisanrao Dhonde (70) of Dahegaon in Gangapur tehsil said the heavy rains brought about by the retreating monsoons have destroyed his crops. \"My farm is spread over 6.5 acres. I had sown corn and cotton and harvest time was nearing. I had taken a loan of Rs one lakh to cover the cost of production. Now I won't even 30 per cent of this amount from the sale of whatever produce is left,\" he said. Dhonde, whose farm was visited by Thackeray, said his brinjal and okra cultivation has also rotted, leaving his family with a debt of Rs 3 lakh. \"I have no money to make repayments. The state government must help us,\" he said. Dahegaon sarpanch Vikram Raut said loss assessment surveys have not been completed as yet in the area and no aid from the government has reached people in the village so far. The Maharashtra cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to waive crop loans of a total of Rs 964.15 crore taken by farmers from land development banks. The assets and properties of land development banks will be transferred to the state government. The erstwhile Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by Thackeray in 2019 announced that those farmers who repay the crop loan on time will get an incentive. Initially, the amount was Rs 25,000, which was later revised to Rs 50,000. Now in opposition, Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress are demanding a declaration of wet drought in the state in the wake of retreating rain damaging crops of farmers.

Addressing the gathering, the Chief Minister said, \"Deepotsav of Ayodhya was started six years ago under the guidance and inspiration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . This festival of Uttar Pradesh has today become a festival of the country. A grand celebration of the sixth edition of Deepotsav is being held in Ayodhya, which is touching 'new heights of success.\" \"A city, which Lord Shri Ram himself has called 'glorious' (Janmabhoomi Mam Puri Suhavani, Uttar Dish Bah Saryu Pavni)', can never remain abandoned for so long. Deepotsav is now recognized as a significant celebration honoring the resolve of Ram Rajya\", he added. Prior to the Deepotsav event on Ram Ki Paidi, the symbolic coronation program of Lord Shri Ram was organized in Ramkatha Park, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Governor Anandiben Patel, both the Deputy Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh Brajesh Pathak and Keshav Prasad Maurya along with officials of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teeth Kshetra Trust and a large number of saints. \"Today, the entire city of Ayodhya is celebrating the arrival of Lord Shri Ram as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has realized the dream of Ramrajya in India through his resolve for the all-round development of the country and its people,\" CM Yogi said.

The CM recited couplets of Goswami Tulsidas, \"Daihik Daivik Bhautik Taapa, Ramraj Naahi Kaahun Vyapa\", which means in the kingdom of Rama, there was no disease, no divine wrath, and no calamity. The Chief Minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a politician who has imbibed the ideals of Maryada Purushottam Lord Shri Ram and has been working dedicatedly for the last eight and a half years to realize the vision of Ram Rajya in the country. \"During the pandemic, the 135 crore Indians received free treatment, free vaccine, and free test while free ration was provided to 80 crore people without any discrimination. The schemes of the government are reaching every section of society including housing, toilets, electricity connections, and the Ayushman Bharat yojana among others.

The CM went on to say that India has witnessed massive infrastructure growth under the leadership and guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Yogi Adityanath said, \"The double-engine government is working for the welfare of every section without discrimination.\" The Chief Minister added, \"Today, a grand Shri Ram temple is being constructed in Ayodhya, as well as the grand Dham of Lord Vishwanath has been built in Kashi. The rejuvenation work of the 'Char Dhams' of Uttarakhand being carried out gives a feeling of pride to every Indian.\" He further remarked, \"Today the revival of Vindhyavasini Dham through the construction of a corridor is going on a war footing. Ramayana circuit, Krishna circuit, Buddhist circuit, or restoration work of Shakti Peethas across the country is going on under the leadership of PM. All these are attempts to honor India's rich heritage.\" The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is aiming to advance India's development in line with Lord Shri Ram's objectives, he concluded.

During India's chase of 160, the Men in Blue had a poor start, losing four wickets for just 30 runs. The last time India played Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, which was last year in Dubai, the Indians ended up in the losing side, which was their first-ever defeat to these opponents in a World Cup game. Therefore, there was a sigh of relief on Kohli and Co's faces on Sunday when Ravichandran Ashwin hit the winning runs. \"It's a surreal atmosphere, I have no words, no idea how that happened. I am really lost for words. Hardik believed we can do it, if we stayed till the end. When Shaheen bowled from the pavilion end, that's when we decided to take him down.

It was the highest partnership for India against Pakistan for any wicket in T20Is.\"From 28 in 8, it came down to 16 to 6. I tried to stick to my instincts. The first one was the back of a hand slower ball (the one over long-on). Standing here I just feel like it was meant to be. Till today Mohali was my best innings against Australia. Today I will count this one higher. Hardik kept pushing me. The crowd has been phenomenal. You guys (fans) kept backing me and I am grateful for your support,\" added Kohli. Meanwhile, with his latest knock, Kohli also surpassed Rohit Sharma in the list of most runs in T20Is. Kohli is the leading run-scorer in the shortest format on the international level with 3,794 runs in 110 games at a strike rate of 138.41 and an average of 51.97.

The recent development around Charles Barkley’s contract with TNT provided a sigh of relief for fans of the award-winning show Inside the NBA. Earlier this year, the former MVP had caused quite a storm with rumors of him holding talks with LIV Golf, who reportedly offered him a fortune. An avid golfer, Barkley maintained that for him to leave TNT, he’d expect a ridiculous offer numbers-wise. Fortunately, for fans of Inside the NBA, The Chuckster wasn’t made a formal offer. Not wanting to keep Turner in limbo, the 59-year-old signed a massive deal with the network. The way the deal is structured, if TNT retains the rights to the NBA, Barkley’s deal goes for another 7 years.https://t.co/Kq3hESbyMU — Andrew Marchand (@AndrewMarchand) October 17, 2022 A 10-year contract meant Chuck wasn’t going anytime soon, given he had in the past voiced his desire to retire from the show once his two-year contract expired. “We’re all a big family — Ernie, Kenny and Shaquille are brothers to me — and I wouldn’t still be here if it wasn’t for them and all the amazing people who work on our show,” Barkley told New York Post. “I’m not gonna lie, though, this is a life-altering deal … and I’m blessed to be able to do live television for a living.” Also read: “Just Wait Until This Guy Finds Out About Stand Up Comedy”: NBA Twitter Reacts to Charles Barkley’s 10-year Contract with TNT During a recent appearance on the Dan Patrick Show, Barkley would at length discuss his new contract with TNT.

When asked if the LIV Golf negotiations affect his contract with TNT, Barkley answered, “Zero Percent.” “TNT asked me, we need something from you, would you give us something and I said, ‘what do you want?’ they’re like we need you to stay longer, we can’t lose you, and be it on the NBA.” Barkley revealed the producers wanted him to stay for at least 3-years and that they were going to bid on the NBA. When asked if he could sign for a couple of more years, the veteran forward said the following. “Well you guys have been great to me, I’ll stay on a couple of more years, and I mean there’s probably zero chance, I’m gonna stay for the entire 10 years.” Speaking about his meeting with Turner, The $60 million worth Barkley said “I met with Turner personally, I’m not worried about money at this stage of my life. Listen, if I don’t have money by now, I’m a big idiot. I mean, I played 16 years in the NBA, and this is my 22nd year starting the night on Turner.” Whatever may be the case, this serves as great news for fans of Inside the NBA, given the show would never be the same without him. Charles Barkley is a laugh riot. Sir Charles is one of the most entertaining personalities in the history of American sports broadcasting. Every word that the TNT analyst says on-air can constitute promo shots. The Alabama native has changed the landscape of sports broadcasting with his bold nature.

We were in no position to win this. The way we won that's more pleasing for us. Hats off to Virat for the way he batted, has to be the best innings he has played for India. I would like to thank everyone, it's wonderful to see. Their support for us is very, very crucial wherever we go,\" added Rohit.https://twitter.com/imVkohli/status/1584170142254084098 Even Pakistan skipper Babar Azam hailed Kohli. \"Our bowlers bowled really well. All credit to Kohli and Pandya. It wasn't easy with the new ball. We had partnerships after 10 overs. We had a chance. We tried to stick to our plans. But credit to Virat Kohli. In the middle we decided we wanted a wicket and held the spinner back. We had a lot of positives. The way Iftikhar played and the way Shan played,\" said Babar. India's next game is on Thursday (Oct. 27) against Netherlands at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). On the same day, Pakistan are also in action as they are scheduled to lock horns with Zimbabwe at Perth Stadium.\nthehansindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/kohli-played-his-best-innings-for-india-says-rohit-after-4-wicket-win-ov/","tags":["Sports,Top Stories,Cricket"],"title":"Kohli played his 'best innings for India,' says Rohit after 4-wicket win over Pakistan"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Apple iPhone owners report Face ID issues after iOS update, know more MacRumours claims that there were issues with resetting Face ID on Apple devices with iOS 15.7.1 update.\ndnaindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/apple-iphone-owners-report-face-id-issues-after-ios-update-know-more/","tags":["Technology"],"title":"Apple iPhone owners report Face ID issues after iOS update, know more"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Explained | CCI’s ₹1,300 crore fine on Google and how that will change Android smartphones How is the Alphabet owned company allegedly violating its position especially with regard to the Android mobile device ecosystem?

After some one-sided contests in the ‘Super 12’ stage of the ongoing T20 World Cup 2022, arch-rivals India and Pakistan gifted the fans with an absolute cracker of a contest which went down to the wire, with India sealing victory off the final Over of their chase by 4 wickets. As the tournament moves on with the ‘Super 12’ teams, South Africa will take on Zimbabwe in the third match of the ‘Super 12 Group 2’ on Monday, at the Blundstone Arena, in Hobart. Zimbabwe, on the back of couple of wins during the group/qualifying stage earlier, managed to make it through to the next round, with their batting allrounder Sikander Raza proving to be their match-winner on both these occasions. ALSO READ: Bangladesh versus Netherlands tomorrow’s Super 12 match pitch report However, apart from him and Craig Ervine, none of the other batters in their line-up have managed to impress so far, which might hurt them big time against a quality South African attack tomorrow. As for South Africa, who recently lost the three-match away T20I series against India, will for certain be the favourites to win tomorrow’s contest, with eyes on their pace bowling attack, at the fast, bouncy pitches Down Under. SA vs ZIM pitch report Blundstone Arena The Bellerive Oval or the Blundstone Arena at Hobart, has already hosted a few matches during the qualifying stage of the World Cup earlier. The Proteas pace battery might well dictate terms during the contest tomorrow, as the fast bowlers at this venue have scalped 31 wickets in this year’s World Cup so far, at a strike rate of 14.4 during the night matches. With overcast conditions also expected during match time, expect the pacers to make further inroads, thereby making it a bit challenging for the batters. The average score across the seven matches this World Cup so far at this venue, has been 153.4 runs, which might well turn out to be a match-winning total after batting first. “The surface seems to be true, it is a solid track. Sri Lanka would want to bat first. There will be a bit of bounce and spin, maybe 160 would be par. The game within the game would be how the teams play against the shorter boundary with the breeze,” remarked former Australian pacer Dirk Nannes about the pitch at this venue, during the previous match here between Ireland and Sri Lanka today.

In fact, maintaining your passwords and data is more vital than ever as we become a more tech-reliant society. Today, I’m going to show you how to manage your Google Passwords like a pro and why you may want to check in on them frequently. We may make this into a series in the future to show you how to manage your other online accounts to maintain your safety and privacy, but today, we’re going for the big one. Why it’s important Our society is ripe with people who would seek to take advantage of those who are less tech-literate or savvy about how online accounts and information work. Luckily, Google has created the Safer with Google initiative . Here, they teach you a ton of great tips and tricks and even give you the tools you need to stay safe as you and your family browse online. One specific area I want to highlight, of course, is your passwords. Google Passwords is a one-stop shop for adding, modifying and removing saved passwords for any website you visit in the Chrome browser. By visiting Google Passwords on the web, you can let Google automatically tell you what needs to be changed or fixed to make your accounts ironclad. How to perform a Password Checkup The Password Checkup tool can be launched using the blue button below. One you arrive at the destination, a blue “Check Passwords” button will be waiting for you. Clicking it will have several benefits! First and foremost, it will show you how many and which of your online accounts are utilizing “compromised” passwords. These are items you should consider changing the password for immediately as they have likely suffered from a data breach, where your personal information was stolen from that company by a third party or otherwise exposed publicly. You can also check for such breaches at haveibeenpwned . Launch Password Checkup Compromised Passwords As you can see, prior to cleaning all of this up, I had 49 compromised passwords! That’s pretty scary, but the truth is that data breaches happen practically every week nowadays, and it’s a risk of using digital services. That’s not to say it should be accepted, but you should check back on the Password Checkup tool frequently to watch for them. Pro Tip: You can install the Google Password Alert extension from the Chrome Web Store to be notified when entering your password on any website. This will allow you to determine whether or not your data is safe. Fair warning though, it’s super annoying when it redirects you each time you enter your password on sites you trust, but it can be turned off for that site pretty easily! Duplicate or shared passwords The next section on the checkup tool tells you how many passwords are being reused or shared across different online accounts. Ideally, every website you visit should use a completely unique and different password, and this is much easier when Chrome auto-fills across both the browser and mobile. However, the truth is that the cultural operation of passwords has been nearly entirely dependent on the human brain – the most fallible and weakest link in the chain. Social engineering relies on humans to slip up or to create patterns, and hackers take these opportunities to figure out what your password may be. In other words, if they discover your password for one site, they can almost be sure it’s your password for another site or many others. The screenshot above is a very old one, and I’ve had it saved for a while, so luckily, I’m not sharing the same password across 553 sites anymore. Instead, I let Chrome randomly generate secure passwords for each of them and also let it store them on my behalf. I recommend doing this to avoid patterns! Weak Passwords Lastly, the “Weak Passwords” section shows you how many and which of your online accounts is using a password that’s not as secure as it could be. Normally, having a password be at least 8 characters with a capital letter, lower case letters, numbers, symbols, and so on strengthens it and makes it harder for an opportunist to guess, even with tools like hash tables. Once again, if you’re having trouble coming up with unique passwords that meet these criteria, you can allow Chrome to auto-generate something for you that fits the bill. I can’t stress this enough! If you’re worried about not being able to sign in on another device, make sure that said device has your Google Account synchronizing to it so that your passwords will be detected and injected into form fields automatically! As Google seeks to kill the password entirely, this entire ordeal may not be necessary anymore, but passwords themselves are a product of a bygone era (or rather one that’s passing before our very eyes!) In due time, the word “password” will be a joke we tell our grandkids, but the idea of safety and online security with privacy tools that account protection will never be a thing of the past. Change your passwords often The common consensus for how often you ought to freshen up your passwords and change them to something new is generally every three months. There may be circumstances like the aforementioned data breaches and so on that cause you to consider changing them even more frequently. If there is a data breach on a website and Google informs you, you should take time to change that account’s password immediately! My advice to you is to visit the Google Password Checkup tool once every two to three months and simply go through all three sections until the check marks are no longer red or yellow but green. If you’re not a fan of Google Passwords, then I recommend you use something like Dashlane, One Password, or Lastpass (but never lose your master password or you’ll lose access to all of the passwords in the vault!) Knowledge is half the battle My last word of wisdom to you is to avoid storing passwords for your bank, Google Account, or any other online presence you maintain on paper, in a Keep note, or another plain text editor, or really anywhere else. It may be more convenient, but it can be something you regret for a long time to come if you become a victim of cybercrime! You don’t have to be like me who creates all of his passwords in other languages, or like those super techy individuals who create randomized strings of characters and memorizes them, but by utilizing the tools at your disposal and keeping up with the technology, you can maintain a safe online presence for you and your family without also constantly dealing with the headache of them.

Naresh Patel, a local industrialist, runs the cash-rich Khodaldham Trust for the welfare of the community. Gujarat govt's pre-election Diwali gift: No fines on traffic violations for 7 daysThe meeting between Patel and PM Modi is said to be crucial, given that it comes ahead of the Gujarat polls, which are likely to be announced soon.All the political parties have been wooing Naresh Patel for at least a year now and the latter has had meetings at the highest level with the BJP, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), after he dropped hints of his inclination to join politics. After hectic parleys with all of them many times, Patel finally announced that he had dropped his idea of plunging into politics, as desired by the community leaders.But speculation has begun again after Patel met Modi in Delhi. Patel has claimed the meeting was only to invite the Prime Minister to Khodaldham on October 31 and unfurl the Patidar flag. He told reporters that it was a courtesy call and no politics was discussed. Still, BJP sources said, the meeting itself was adequate to inspire the party cadres.State BJP President CR Paatil, however, said the meeting would go a long way in strengthening the party's prospects in the coming elections.Ramesh Tilara, a trustee of Khodaldham Trust who accompanied Patel during his meeting with Modi, said it was “a goodwill visit” and to invite the prime minister to Khodaldham. Modi is yet to confirm his date, according to Tilara.Paatil also told reporters: \"BJP workers are themselves geared up, but when the chief of a prestigious social and religious institution like Khodaldham Trust meets the PM, it instills confidence among the BJP cadres that they will achieve the targets for the elections.”The opposition Congress party had also tried to woo Naresh Patel, and his latest meetings were with Gujarat Congress chief Jagdish Thakor and Rajya Sabha MP Shaktisinh Gohil, among others.\nfreepressjournal\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/gujarat-pm-narendra-modis-meet-with-patidar-leader-sets-tongues-wagging/","tags":["India","Topnews"],"title":"Gujarat: PM Narendra Modi’s meet with Patidar leader sets tongues wagging"},{"categories":["science"],"contents":"Space news weekly recap: Returning asteroid samples, birth of a black hole and more - The Indian Express Space news weekly recap: Returning asteroid samples, birth of a black hole and more The Indian Express\ngoogle\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/space-news-weekly-recap-returning-asteroid-samples-birth-of-a-black-hole-/","tags":[],"title":"Space news weekly recap: Returning asteroid samples, birth of a black hole and more - The Indian Express"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Kohli is one of the best chasers in the world: Rohit after Kohli’s 82 not out vs PAK Kohli is one of the best chasers in the world: Rohit after Kohli’s 82 not out vs PAK\nindiatoday\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/kohli-is-one-of-the-best-chasers-in-the-world-rohit-after-kohlis-82-not/","tags":[],"title":"Kohli is one of the best chasers in the world: Rohit after Kohli’s 82 not out vs PAK"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Jagan to launch third 800-MW unit of supercritical thermal power plant in Andhra Pradesh on October 27 The Chief Minister to also disburse non-fishermen package to the displaced people pending since former Chief Minister Rajasekhara Reddy’s term\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/jagan-to-launch-third-800-mw-unit-of-supercritical-thermal-power-plant-in-a/","tags":[],"title":"Jagan to launch third 800-MW unit of supercritical thermal power plant in Andhra Pradesh on October 27"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Andhra Pradesh: Sankar Foundation to conduct mega eye camp to mark Swaroopanandendra Swami’s birthday on October 28 thehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/andhra-pradesh-sankar-foundation-to-conduct-mega-eye-camp-to-mark-swaroopa/","tags":[],"title":"Andhra Pradesh: Sankar Foundation to conduct mega eye camp to mark Swaroopanandendra Swami’s birthday on October 28"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Anushka Sharma danced and screamed after India’s win over Pakistan, calls Virat Kohli ‘a wonderful man’ indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/anushka-sharma-danced-and-screamed-after-indias-win-over-pakistan-calls/","tags":["Bollywood","Entertainment"],"title":"Anushka Sharma danced and screamed after India’s win over Pakistan, calls Virat Kohli ‘a wonderful man’"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Smart garbage monitoring app for Thrikkakara too thehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/smart-garbage-monitoring-app-for-thrikkakara-too/","tags":[],"title":"Smart garbage monitoring app for Thrikkakara too"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Southampton v Arsenal: Premier League – live Match at St Mary’s kicks off at 2pm BSTGet in touch with Gregg via email or on TwitterThe teams are out at St Mary’s on what has ended up being a lovely day for football after the torrential showers earlier.

Upon arrival, he opened the box only to know that he has received a box full of e-waste and old computer parts. Just like some of us, he had only seen such frauds happening on social media platforms but witnessed it in real for the first time. Flipkart Plus user gets a giant stone and e-waste when ordered a gaming laptop On October 15th, Chinmaya ordered a gaming laptop, the Asus TUF Gaming F15, for his friend since he had a Flipkart Plus membership. The product was delivered on October 20, seal-packed from the outside. It wasn’t an open-box delivery like some of the items on Flipkart, but the buyer did share an OTP with the delivery person since the box looked just fine. However, when the main Flipkart packaging was opened, the Asus box inside was tampered and the barcodes and product details were removed. When the box was opened, there was everything but a laptop. It had old computer parts and e-waste along with a stone, which was apparently kept to keep the box heavy. As soon as this was learned by the buyer, he raised a return request which wasn’t approved by the seller. When the matter was known by Flipkart, it contacted the seller, however, the seller responded that the product was intact. Now, the buyer, Chinmaya, is in hopes that Flipkart investigates the issue as soon as possible and returns or refunds him. “I reported the same to Flipkart on the same day with all the proofs. They answered me that they need some time to get back with solution. On 23rd October they emailed me that the seller rejected the return request and the product is not at all damaged during the transportation,” said the buyer Chinmaya. This isn’t the first time that such scams are happening. Recently, a person ordered a laptop from Flipkart in the Big Billion Days sale but he received a detergent soap.

The New Orleans Pelicans are one of the whole four teams remaining in the Western Conference yet to lose a game. While the likes of Brandon Ingram, Jonas Valancuinas, and CJ McCollum have been balling out, the return of Zion Williamson has been extremely crucial for Willie Green and co. After missing out on the entire 2021-2022 campaign due to a foot injury, the 22-year-old averaged 11.3/3.3/2.8 in the 2022 preseason. Looking fitter than ever before, “Zanos” has been extremely dominant in NOLA’s first two outings.

In the clash between two undefeated teams, the main question is, will Williamson take on the floor tonight? Zion Williamson will look to dominate against the Jazz The former Duke Blue Devil has been sensational in the wins against the Nets \u0026 the Hornets. On 19th October, the 1-time All-Star wrecked havoc in the paint and recorded a 25-point, 9-rebound performance. View this post on Instagram A post shared by New Orleans Pelicans (@pelicansnba) In the bout against the Charlotte-based franchise, the highflyer put up 16 points in 31 minutes. NOLA fans can expect Zion to be a focal point during the Pels-Hornets clash, as he is expected to suit up on Sunday night. Unlike Kira Lewis Jr. (Out), E.J. Liddell (Out), and Jaxson Hayes (Questionable), Zion isn’t mentioned on the team’s injury report. Can NOLA go 3-0? The Pelicans haven’t disappointed yet. In the first two clashes, Brandon Ingram and co. have not yet trailed at any point. In the last 25 years, the Pels are only the fifth team to do so. The Pelicans are the fifth team in the last 25 years not to trail at any point in their first two regular season games, per @ESPNStatsInfo. The other four teams: – 2011-12 Hawks – 2004-05 Jazz – 2004-05 Heat – 1997-98 Hawks — Andrew Lopez (@_Andrew_Lopez) October 22, 2022 The big four of the Pels have been sensational so far. Agreed two games is a small sample space, however, averaging 92 PPG out of NOLA’s 127, must be satisfactory for Willie Green. pic.twitter.com/aWl8NK9SRl — Andrew Lopez (@_Andrew_Lopez) October 22, 2022 To be honest, it’ll be pretty easy for JV and “Zanos” to dominate the paint and boards while going up against the likes of Lauri Markkanen and Kelly Olynyk. There is a huge possibility that we see the New Orleans-based franchise grab the win on Sunday.

Continue reading...\nP alms sweat, heartbeat quickens, muscles tense. Your skin prickles and stomach churns. When fear subsides, we can be left with feelings of pleasure. Is this just the relief of having survived – or is it something more? Fight or flight The amygdala , an almond-shaped bundle of neurons deep in the centre of the brain, controls the fear response. In a fearful situation, the amygdala stimulates the hypothalamus , which activates two systems in the body – the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal cortical system – causing a flash flood of hormones and triggering the fight-or-flight response. Adrenaline boosts the body’s alertness. It speeds up the heart rate and diverts blood from the core to the muscles needed for movement. Cortisol raises blood pressure . Blood vessels around the vital organs dilate, flooding them with oxygen and nutrients. Breathing quickens, delivering fresh oxygen to the brain, while levels of glucose in the blood spike , giving the body a quick energy boost – ready for action. “Although we have an understanding of some aspects of neural fear networks and how they coordinate behaviour, there are still many unknowns,” says Dr Charlotte Lawrenson, a neuroscientist at Bristol University. In early societies, fear-inducing tales were used to teach children about dangers they might encounter When we are exposed to sensory stimuli or an environment that is potentially threatening, she says, two pathways are activated in the brain. The first is fast. Information is transferred to the sensory thalamus and then to the amygdala, allowing for immediate action on the threatening stimuli. The second is a slower, indirect route. Information is sent from the thalamus to the cortex, the outermost layer of the brain, associated with consciousness, reasoning and memory. This analyses the threat and allows us to determine whether we are in real danger. “We do not know exactly where the feeling of fear occurs in the brain,” says Lawrenson, “but it is likely to be from the coordinated activation of a fear network involving multiple brain regions.” If the threat is determined to be real, other areas of the brain will be activated to initiate a whole-body response to the danger. This includes the periaqueductal grey, which coordinates the antinociceptive, autonomic and behavioural reactions to stress and injury, blocking the detection of pain by sensory neurons and kickstarting the involuntary physiological processes and responding action. “The memory of [the danger] will be transferred and stored in the hippocampus,” adds Lawrenson’s co-researcher, Dr Elena Paci, “so that we are able to remember and identify the threat at the next encounter.” A window on our collective fears Fear is an ancient emotion and scary stories are ingrained in human history. In early societies , fear-inducing tales were used to teach children about dangers they might encounter, such as wolves and other predators. Today, cinema offers a window into society’s collective fears. In the 1954 sci-fi film, Godzilla was created by nuclear radiation, revealing the shared anxiety about the second world war atomic attacks. Horror films have often featured technology – robots that revolt against their creator like the Westworld hosts, or murderous AI such as Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Skynet in The Terminator . In the late 1970s and the 1980s, Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger made their appearances alongside the emergence of the serial killer in the public consciousness . Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street. Photograph: Ronald Grant In March 2020, when the pandemic went into hyperdrive, downloads of the movie Contagion – about a deadly pandemic – surged. Why did people want to watch a horror film about something so real to them at that point in time? Prof Marc Malmdorf-Andersen and his colleagues think that horror films have learning potential for uncertainty management. Navigating an unpredictable world An associate professor at Denmark’s Aarhus University, Malmdorf-Andersen researches the cognitive processes involved in play and learning. “Spending time in these fictional realms can almost be thought of as an opportunity to draft up your own instruction book for worst-case scenarios,” he says. A study on horror fans during the Covid pandemic found that people who enjoyed watching scary films were more psychologically resilient than non-horror fans. “They have, in some ways, been exposed to similar scenarios and might use that experience for navigating new, uncertain realities,” says Malmdorf-Andersen. “It is possible that recreational forms of fear in general can help improve emotion regulation and coping skills.” Enjoyment of fear, says Malmdorf-Andersen, makes sense if you look at it as a “form of play”. “Enjoyment of scary stimuli seems to be related to getting a grip on unpredictable situations,” he says. “In much the same way, children’s play is characterised by seeking out moderate amounts of uncertainty, moderate surprises, in an effort to make sense of them.” In fact, researchers at Exeter University say that when children’s play involves risk and fear, it can function as a protective factor against anxiety . Play, says Malmdorf-Andersen, is a strategy for learning how to deal with unfamiliar situations and making the unpredictable predictable. The sweet spot To investigate the relationship between enjoyment and fear, Malmdorf-Andersen and his colleagues at Aarhus University’s Recreational Fear Lab studied a group of people who went to a haunted house visitor attraction. There, the guests voluntarily signed up to be terrified by brain-munching zombies, chainsaw-wielding maniacs and child-eating murderers. The researchers filmed the guests, monitored their heart rates and asked them how they felt at various points during the experience. “At Dystopia Haunted House there are about 70-100 scare actors each night,” says Malmdorf-Andersen, “and a large special-effects department. They challenge their guests on a lot of different levels – disgust, fear, jump scare, unease, being alone, being in the dark, claustrophobia…” The findings indicated that humans don’t enjoy being too far from their normal physiological state, but they do enjoy being just a little bit out of their comfort zone. “Our results suggest that there might be a ‘sweet spot’ between fear and enjoyment,” says Malmdorf-Andersen. “A just-right spot where the context is not too terrifying, but not too tame either. This sweet spot seems to be where enjoyment is maximised.” At that spot, a flood of fear quickly followed by relief results in the release of feelgood chemicals in the brain – endorphins and dopamine – rewarding you with a rush of euphoria. When fear goes too far However, it is important to keep in mind that everyone is different. We all have a unique sense of what we find scary – and it’s a fine line between harmless fun and genuine terror. Too much fear can lead to distress and dysfunction . Globally, about 275 million people suffer from anxiety disorders , which can become chronic and debilitating and affect a person’s life trajectory. “Different people have a different level of activation of certain areas [of the brain],” says Paci. What can be a thrill for one person can be truly terrifying for another. So dare to be scared this Halloween – but just the right amount.\ntheguardian\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/why-we-enjoy-fear-the-science-of-a-good-scare/","tags":["Psychology","Halloween","Neuroscience","Science"],"title":"Why we enjoy fear: the science of a good scare"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Gandhi family, its NGOs not above law: BJP on cancellation of FCRA licences The BJP on Sunday welcomed the cancellation of the FCRA licences of two NGOs headed by former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, and said the Gandhi family and organisations linked to them can't be above law.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government last month re-imposed a complete ban on the production, sale and use of all types of firecrackers till January 1, 2023, including on Diwali, a practice it has been following for the last two years.

Production, storage and sale of firecrackers in the capital will be punishable with a fine of up to Rs 5,000 and three years jail under Section 9B of the Explosives Act, Rai had said. Ahead of the Gujarat Assembly polls due later this year, AAP national convener Kejriwal has visited the state multiple times in the recent past to garner support for his party.

Some of the weather stations there have never recorded any rain in all of their years of operation.\nThe driest place on Earth is the Atacama desert, which is located along the western coast of South America's cone and stretches for about 1,600 kms. Some of the weather stations there have never recorded any rain in all of their years of operation. But it's far from lifeless; many species that are unique to this region and have adapted to its harsh conditions can be found here. Additionally, the Atacama hosts one of the most breathtaking natural phenomena on average once every five to ten years, from mid-September to mid-November: the \"desierto florido\" (literally, \"blooming desert\"). Following heavy rainfall earlier this year, one of these mass blooms, which is currently occurring in northern Atacama, is frequently covered by media from all over the world. However, what physiological and evolutionary processes allow for the enormous variety of flower colours, shapes, and visual patterns found in desiertos floridos? And how do pollinators, primarily hymenopterans like solitary wasps and bees in the Atacama, who are the beneficiaries of this visual extravaganza, perceive all this variety? A recent study published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution addresses this issue. \"Our aim was to shed light on the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that cause biological diversity in extreme environments like the Atacama desert,\" said first author Dr Jaime Martinez-Harms, a researcher at the Institute of Agricultural Research in La Cruz, Chile. \"Here we show that flowers of the pussypaw Cistanthe longiscapa, a representative species for desiertos floridos in the Atacama desert, are highly variable in the colour and patterns they present to pollinators. This variability probably results from different so-called 'betalain' pigments in the flower petals.\" Model species Late in 2021, a desierto Florido event was studied by Martnez-Harms and colleagues close to the northern Chilean city of Caldera. Even though it was smaller than the current event, satellites could clearly see it. A dominant species was the annual plant C. longiscapa (family Montiaceae), which bloomed in two distinct patches tens of kilometres apart and reached a height of 20 cm. To human eyes, these patches were composed of exclusively purple and yellow flowers. Numerous intermediate flowers of the same species--reddish, pinkish, and white--grew in between them, providing strong evidence that the purple and yellow morphs are heritable variations that are capable of interbreeding. Visualizing flowers as insects see them Insects, with their compound eyes and different sensitivities, see the world very differently than we do. For example, most hymenopterans have three types of photoreceptors, which are maximally sensitive to UV, blue, and green. Martinez-Harms et al used cameras sensitive to visible light and UV and spectrometers to measure the reflection, absorption, and transmission of different wavelengths by the petals of a total of 110 purple, yellow, red, pink, and white C. longiscapa flowers. This enabled them to produce composite images of these variants as seen by their many species of pollinators. Diversity hidden from human eyes The results show that just within this single plant species, the diversity perceptible to pollinators was greater than to us. For example, hymenopterans, just like us, can easily distinguish between red, purple, white, and yellow variants. But they can also distinguish between flowers with a high versus a low UV reflection among yellow and purple flowers. A UV 'bullseye pattern' at the heart of some flowers, which guides pollinators to the nectar and pollen, is invisible to us. An exception is UV-reflecting pink and reddish C. longiscapa, which are quite distinct to human eyes, but probably appear similar to hymenopterans. This visual diversity of C. longiscapa flowers is probably mainly due to differences between betalains - yellow, orange, and purple pigments that are a typical trait of the plant order Caryophyllales to which the pussypaws belong. Betalains don't just give colours to flowers: they also protect from drought, salt stress, and damage from reactive oxygen radicals under environmental stress - traits highly beneficial in deserts. Pollinators drive the selection of new variants The authors proposed that the observed standing diversity within C. longiscapa flowers is caused by variations in pollinator sensitivity to and preference for various colours and patterns--a current evolutionary experiment that largely goes unnoticed by humans. \"The great variation in flower colour within C. longiscapa can be explained if different species of pollinating insects, through their preference for particular flower colours and patterns, could cause these variants to become reproductively isolated from other individuals of the same plant species. This ongoing process could ultimately lead to the origin of new races or species,\" said Martinez-Harms. \"In our next studies, we will further investigate the chemical identity and the biological synthesis pathways of betalains and other flower pigments, as well as their relationship to traits such as the scents produced by the flowers. This should help us to understand their role in shaping the interactions between plants and their pollinators, and in the plants' tolerance to biotic and abiotic stressors under fluctuating climate conditions,\" said Martinez-Harms.

Things were smooth for Vijayan from 2016, when he first took over as the new chief minister and things remained the same even when Arif Mohammed Khan - a surprise choice by the national BJP leadership - was appointed the Governor in 2019. A seasoned politician, 70-year-old Khan who has travelled across quite a few political parties, starting from age 26, in a short time had won the hearts of many a Keralite through his affable and friendly approach and had no airs of the highly decorative post of his. But Khan first raised eyebrows when two years back he threatened not to read out adverse remarks about the Narendra Modi government, but later he changed his stand. From then on, it was a different Khan one saw, especially when it came to issues with the Vijayan government. He was at odds over the position taken by the Vijayan government on the Citizenship Amendment Act and from then on it was a series of tussles with Khan, giving headaches to the state government. He soon got the tag of being the principal 'opposition party' replacing the Congress led UDF. Then came the issue of the reappointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor Gopinath Ravindran and after coming down heavily on it, Khan quietly inked the reappointment. He then blew hot over the appointment of Priya Varghese, wife of Vijayan's private secretary K.K. Ragesh, to a teaching job in the same university and he put his foot down. When the Kerala High Court took a similar stand, it gave Khan an edge in his tiff with the Vijayan government. In between he made a scathing attack on the way personal staff members were appointed and even though he promised to take strict action, so far nothing has happened. And things got more bitter when he refused to ink the controversial tweaking of the Lok Ayukta Ordinance, forcing Vijayan to call a special sitting of the legislature. Khan is presently sitting on the Bill. If these issues were not enough, recently Khan dismissed 15 nominated senate members of Kerala University after they, despite being warned to be present at a crucial senate meeting, did not turn up. Khan also warned the state ministers not to speak disparagingly about him and threatened that it could lead to the withdrawal of his 'pleasure', clearly implying that if they continue in the same manner such ministers might be booted out. Vijayan however maintained a stoic silence, but came down heavily early his week when he said the rights, responsibilities and duties of the Governor are clearly mentioned in the Constitution as are those of the ministers. Even B. R. Ambedkar, the principal architect of India's Constitution, has said the powers of the Governor are very narrow and the apex court has also clarified that the Governor should work according to the directions of the cabinet. \"Everything is clearly written and when such a situation is there, can anyone say otherwise,\" added Vijayan. To a question on the way Khan dismissed 15 senate members of Kerala University, he said what he has done is not tenable under the law and moreover the common principle of extending natural justice was also not adhered to. But state Congress president K. Sudhakaran, the biggest opponent of Vijayan, said there are very valid points raised by Khan. \"One needs to assess things which he has raised and all what he has raised just cannot be dismissed. There is merit in certain things that he has taken up with the state government,\" said Sudhakaran. State BJP president K. Surendran also did not lose any opportunity to take on Vijayan and also the Congress and pointed out that when it comes to attacking Khan, who was appointed by the Centre, these two political parties are hand in glove. The BJP will defend Khan, as he has done nothing wrong. --IANS sg/bg (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/guv-arif-keeps-blowing-hot-but-cm-pinarayi-says-this-is-kerala/","tags":[],"title":"Guv Arif keeps blowing hot, but CM Pinarayi says 'This is Kerala'"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"No end in sight to tug-of-war between Jharkhand Governor, Soren govt The role of Syed Sibte Razi had sparked intense controversy in 2005 when he administered the oath of chief ministership to Shibu Soren, the leader of the UPA\nTen Governors have been appointed in Jharkhand since it came into existence as a state about 22 years and 11 months ago. Of these, the tenure of Syed Sibte Razi, who was Governor between 2004 and 2009, and Ramesh Bais, the 10th Governor, will be remembered for political controversies. The role of Syed Sibte Razi had sparked intense controversy in 2005 when he administered the oath of chief ministership to Shibu Soren, the leader of the UPA, instead of the leader of the single largest party, the BJP, after the assembly election results. Soren had to resign after nine days as he was not able to prove his majority and then Arjun Munda was sworn in as CM. The tenure of the current Governor Ramesh Bais began on July 7, 2021. During his tenure of nearly one and a half years till now, there have been reports of differences, tensions and disagreements between Raj Bhavan and the state government on at least three-four occasions. For the past two months, a political tug of war has been going on between Governor Ramesh Bais and Chief Minister Hemant Soren over a letter from the Election Commission of India. This sealed letter reached Raj Bhavan in Ranchi from New Delhi on August 25. This letter is related to deciding the eligibility-disqualification of Chief Minister Hemant Soren, but even after 59 days it has not been officially disclosed what is the text of this letter. Soren and the state's ruling coalition have alleged that political uncertainty and confusion have been created due to non-disclosure of this letter. On the other hand, the Governor has publicly said that it is his discretion when and what decision he will take on this letter. No one should question this. The letter pertains to a case related to Hemant Soren's Office of Profit and alleged violation of the Representation of the People Act. Soren had taken a stone quarry on lease with an area of 88 decimils in his name in Anagada in Ranchi while being the Chief Minister. However, no mining work took place there and later Soren surrendered the lease. The BJP had complained to the Governor calling it a case of violation of the Office of Profit and Representation of the People Act. The Governor had sought the opinion of the Election Commission on this. The commission issued notice to the complainant and Hemant Soren and sought their response in this matter. After hearing both the sides, the Election Commission had sent its decision in a sealed cover to the Raj Bhavan on August 25. Unofficially, news has been doing the rounds that the Election Commission has recommended the cancellation of Hemant Soren's assembly membership considering him guilty and because of this he may lose his Chief Minister's chair. Amid the political suspense and confusion created by such reports, the ruling coalition had to undertake 'dinner diplomacy' and 'resort stay' to express solidarity with Hemant Soren . The ruling coalition also passed a motion of trust in Soren's favour in a special session of the assembly. Despite all this, the Governor has not yet revealed the contents of the letter and due to this the Hemant Soren government is going through a period of uncertainty about its future. On September 15, Soren met Bais and demanded that he clarify the situation regarding the letter of the Election Commission. He told the Governor that there is an atmosphere of uncertainty in the state. In such a situation, being the constitutional head of the state, he should take appropriate steps to protect democracy and the Constitution. The Chief Minister also requested the Governor in writing to provide him a copy of the decision sent by the Election Commission regarding his membership of the Assembly and the matter should be heard at the earliest. No response has been received from the Governor on this request so far. After this, on October 8, Vinod Pandey, the general secretary of the ruling party JMM, asked for a copy of the letter of the Election Commission by giving an application under the Right to Information Act at the Raj Bhavan. Along with the application, he also submitted a postal order of Rs 10. No response has been received on this as well. About a month ago, when asked what is in the letter of the Election Commission and when will it be opened, the Governor while avoiding the question in a light-hearted manner said that the envelope which has come from the Election Commission is stuck so hard that it is not opening. On October 15, Hemant Soren while talking to reporters at CM House said, \"I am the first Chief Minister of the entire country, who is going from the door of the Election Commission to the Governor, urging them to say if I have committed any crime, then what punishment has been given to me for it? I am asking him time and again that if I am really guilty, then how am I continuing in the post of Chief Minister?\" Hemant Soren also questioned the credibility and transparency of constitutional institutions by naming the Governor during the same press conference. He said that the way the central agencies are working, it seems that there is some power behind them, whose behest they are compelled to follow. Governor Ramesh Bais has raised questions many times in the last eight-ten months on the decisions of the government to the bills passed by the government in the assembly. In February, the Governor had raised many questions on the rules made by the state government regarding the formation of the Tribal Advisory Council (TAC). Bais had complained to the Centre saying that the rules made by the state government in June 2021 are contrary to the constitutional provisions and encroachment on the powers of the governor. He returned the TAC's manual and the file related to its formation to the state government and asked for changes in it. Even after months, there is a deadlock between the Raj Bhavan and the government on this matter. In the last few months, the Governor has returned half a dozen bills including the Anti-Mob Lynching Bill and the Krishi Mandi Bill passed by the state government in the Assembly. Recently, he also returned the bill passed by the government regarding the increase in court fees for reconsideration. During the review of the functioning of the tourism, cultural development, sports and youth affairs department last week, the governor expressed dissatisfaction and even remarked that a lack of vision was evident in the state. Overall, it can be said that there are many chapters yet to be written in the script of tension and confrontation between the Raj Bhavan and the state government in Jharkhand . --IANS snc/uk/bg (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/no-end-in-sight-to-tug-of-war-between-jharkhand-governor-soren-govt/","tags":[],"title":"No end in sight to tug-of-war between Jharkhand Governor, Soren govt"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Tussle between Punjab Governor, AAP govt over Ludhiana VC turns murkier The latest in a series of confrontations is Governor Purohit's directive to CM Bhagwant Mann to remove Satbir Singh Gosal from the post of Ludhiana-based Punjab Agricultural University Vice-Chancellor\nAn 'escalating tussle' between the constitutional head and the democratically elected Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Punjab has turned murkier with the former reminding the government that he took an oath to protect the Constitution and will not allow violation of rules. Without mincing words, Governor Banwarilal Purohit reminded the Bhagwant Mann-led government that in the past one year he didn't utter one word against any person. Rather he has been praising the Chief Minister. The latest in a series of confrontations is Governor Banwarilal Purohit's directive to Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann to remove Satbir Singh Gosal from the post of Ludhiana-based Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Vice-Chancellor. In a letter to the Chief Minister, the Governor termed Gosal's appointment as \"totally illegal\", saying he was appointed by the state government \"without following UGC norms and approval of the Chancellor\". The Governor is the chancellor of the PAU, the country's premier agricultural university established in 1962. The previous \"tussle\" between the duo was over the appointment of cardiologist Gurpreet Wander as Vice Chancellor of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, with the Governor saying the government violated the rules by recommending only one name. Wander later withdrew his candidature as Vice Chancellor. Justifying his decision to ask the government to withdraw the appointment of Gosal as Vice-Chancellor of the PAU, Purohit on Friday told the media in a formal interaction at Raj Bhavan that as the Chancellor of the universities he is performing his duty. \"Rather the government is interfering in his functioning. \"I will perform my duty. I have taken an oath to protect the Constitution. The Chief Minister should realise this. In fact, I administered the oath of office to the Chief Minister. He should not forget that.\" A day earlier the Chief Minister in a letter accused the Governor of \"constantly interfering\" in the government's functioning. Missing no opportunity to take a dig at the AAP government, currently facing Opposition pressure to drop cabinet minister Fauja Singh Sarari on corruption charges, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) said the government has played fraud with the constitutional head of the state as well as Punjabis by sending a letter to the Governor in English but releasing its forged and fabricated version in Punjabi on social media. SAD former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said the fraud had been perpetrated in the name of the Chief Minister along with his signature. \"The Chief Minister should disclose whether he was party to this act and whether it had his acquiescence. If not then the Chief Minister should get an FIR registered in the case and institute a high-level probe into the entire matter. \"Since the issue is also one of constitutional propriety, the SAD also urges the Governor to direct the Chief Minister to order an independent inquiry into the issue and ensure exemplary punishment for those guilty of forging documents as well as their dissemination.\" Cheema said the fact that neither the Chief Minister nor the AAP government had issued a clarification on the issue despite the matter being pointed out by the Governor himself indicated that the AAP was playing politics on the issue. The letter written by the Chief Minister to the Governor in Punjabi justifies the appointment of the PAU Vice-Chancellor. The signed letter, in circulation with the media, says the appointment of Gosal was done in accordance with the Punjab and Haryana Agricultural University Act of 1970. The Chief Minister said the appointment was the prerogative of the PAU board. Hence the Chief Minister or the Governor have no role. \"For the past few months, you have been constantly interfering in the functioning of the government, which was elected with a huge mandate. People of Punjab are very upset because of this,\" the letter quoting Mann said. Raj Bhavan responded on October 20 by clarifying that \"there is a letter in circulation in the media. This letter has not been received in Punjab Raj Bhavan till this moment\". However, it says, the letter received is in English and the contents of both the letters are materially different. Raj Bhavan has sought a clarification from the Chief Minister as to which of his two letters is authentic and why the letter written in Punjabi has been circulated to the media before and without sending it to Punjab Raj Bhavan. A day after the Governor asked the government to remove Gosal, Agriculture Minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal defended the appointment and accused the Governor of interfering in the government's functioning. Dhaliwal told the media here that the order of the Governor challenging the appointment was 'illegal' and said the appointment was made following all norms. Accusing the Governor of acting at the behest of the BJP, he said the Governor is taking unconstitutional action and his letter sent to the government was actually drafted at the BJP headquarters in Delhi. The minister said the AAP government would not tolerate any interference in its work. Dhaliwal said the PAU comes under the Haryana and Punjab Agriculture University Act 1970 and it does not come under the University Grants Commission. He said before taking any action, the Governor should have read the university Act and if it is an 'illegal appointment' then he should clarify why the post of the Vice Chancellor has been vacant for one year. \"The Governor is violating the dignity of his constitutional office. If he wants to do politics then there are elections in Gujarat and Himachal, he must contest elections there,\" Dhaliwal said. He added that the government appointed the two most deserving candidates for the post of two Vice Chancellors but both were objected to by the Governor, which clearly shows that he doesn't want the AAP to function for the development of Punjab and its people. Earlier, the 'rift' between the Governor and Chief Minister Mann was the former taking strong exception to the absence of the Chief Minister at the civic reception organised by him in honour of visiting President Droupadi Murmu. Reminding the Chief Minister of his constitutional obligations that have to be met on such occasions, the Governor, in the presence of President Droupadi Murmu, had said publicly from the stage: \"I had personally called him (Chief Minister) up, but he has not come apparently due to some compulsion.\" \"Whatever the compulsion, the constitutional obligations are more important and have to be fulfilled on such an occasion.\" Mann was also conspicuously absent at the Indian Air Force's 90th Air Show here on that day as he was on a political tour to poll-bound Gujarat along with AAP national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Earlier, the government took exception to the Governor's decision to seek details of legislative business for the Assembly session beginning on September 27. \"I want to ask the Governor to check the record of his office and tell the people how many governors have asked the government to provide information about the purpose of summoning an assembly session. Till today, no governor did it. Only he is doing so, because he is working at the behest of the BJP,\" Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema had said. Responding to the purported 'war of words', the Governor in a missive to the Chief Minister had said, \"Perhaps your opinion about me will definitely change after reading the provisions of Article 167 and 168 of the Constitution, which I'm quoting for your ready reference.\" Chief Minister Mann had clarified that the Governor or President's consent before any session of the legislature is a formality. \"In 75 years, no President or Governor ever asked list of legislative business before calling a session. Legislative business is decided by BAC (Business Advisory Council) and speaker. Next Governor will ask for all speeches also to be approved by him. It's too much,\" Mann had tweeted.

However, the actual implementation would come when the fresh batch of MBBS students begins in November. Three text books in Hindi have been released paving the way for its implementation. Since the day the three MBBS text books were released by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Bhopal, the implementation of this project has started a debate on the entire education system in Madhya Pradesh . The promotion of Hindi through its wider use has been a programme under the BJP government at the Centre as well as in Madhya Pradesh . The New Education Policy-2020 (NEP-2020) lays emphasis on the use of the mother tongue in imparting education. The Congress has questioned the timing of the project as the assembly elections in the state are scheduled in November-December 2023. The opposition has also questioned the implementation of the Hindi medium engineering courses. In 2016, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government started an engineering course in Hindi at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Hindi University in Bhopal. Technical engineering terms were translated from English to Hindi for the purpose. The programme found few takers, and the Congress claims the course has been discontinued. Medical Education Minister Vishwas Sarang, who is monitoring the project, countered the allegations claiming that implementation of Hindi in engineering and medical courses has put paid to the concept that technical and medical courses can only be in the English language. \"There was a fixed concept in mind that medical study can be done in English only, which has now started changing. We have introduced Hindi for engineering courses and the work is still underway, the time will come when people will accept it. These are things which cannot come overnight,\" Sarang said. Dr Vijalaxmi Sadho, who was medical education minister in the Kamal Nath-led Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and is an alumni of Gandhi Medical College, on being asked whether the MBBS course in Hindi is being implemented as a pilot project, accepted that students who come from a Hindi medium background face challenges. However, she believes that the government should have laid more emphasis on improving the education system at the school level, especially in the rural areas of the state. Talking exclusively to IANS, Sadho said, \"Our basic education system is poor and therefore implementation of Hindi or any other language would not achieve its real purpose until the children are imparted quality education. The Shivraj government said that exams should not be conducted for students upto the 9th class. Doing this you have ended a competitive system. In the rural areas, there are several students who have passed their primary level but they can't even write their name. That is why I would say that the government should focus on providing quality education, until then no concept will work.\" She alleged that around 1500 primary and secondary schools were closed in the last few years. She claimed that during the Congress rule between 1993 to 2003, the state had established thousands of primary and secondary schools at a distance of every three to five km. \"The Shivraj government closed over 1500 schools and now CM Rise schools are being established. There is a shortage of teachers at every school in Madhya Pradesh and the same situation prevails in government-run colleges and universities,\" Sadho added. She accused the BJP government of creating a conflict between Hindi and English for its political benefit. \"The BJP has been in power for the last 17 years and it never focused on improving the education system. Now, when the elections are getting closer, they are trying to divert attention from the real issues to hide their failure.\" Sadho, who was also a member of the Department of Public Health in Madhya Pradesh from 1993 to 1998, said, \"I accept that students who have studied in Hindi medium schools face difficulties when they come for higher education, especially in technical and medical courses, but this problem won't end with the introduction of Hindi.

The exercise also included a segment on the Atlantic coast of mainland France. POLARIS 21 was set up entirely in the context of operational preparation on several fronts and had a high combat intensity, which was fully in line with the strategic vision of the Chief of the Armed Forces and the Mercator Acceleration 21 plan of the Chief of Staff of the Admiral of the French navy Pierre Vandier. In addition to naval warfare, the exercise also included the participation of many combat aircraft and surface-to-air defense. Officially, the aim of the training was to test the capabilities of the sea and air elements to face future wars, using the latest systems and naval vessels to develop tactics. The scenario of the exercise was to “enable the Allies to maintain control of the Mediterranean in the event of threat from the Russian air force and navy”. Polaris 2021 “Exercise” The exercise scenario consisted of two troops (Blue and Red), BLUE consisting of the French Carrier Strike Group (CSG), centered around the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier FS Charles de Gaulle (R91), against a RED FORCES credible opposition force ( OPFOR), gathered around the Mistral-class left-hand drive ‘Tonnerre’. In total, the exercise saw the participation of 23 ships, one submarine, 65 aircraft and 6,000 personnel. Partner nations joining the exercise came from Greece, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The United States Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Porter (DDG 78), P-8A Poseidon aircraft from Commander, Task Force 67, and the Henry J. Kaiser-class fleet replenishment oiler USNS John Lenthal (T-AO 189) had a very important place in the “exercise“ POLARIS 2021. Also, U.S. Sixth Fleet, headquartered in Naples, Italy, conducted the full spectrum of joint and naval operations, often in concert with NATO partners, in order to strengthen the power of U.S. in Europe and Africa. The actual goal of the exercise However, journalists came into possession of data related to the exercise POLARIS 2021. The data speak clearly about the advance preparation of the NATO to enter into an armed conflict with the Russian Federation in the event of Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. According to the legend of the maneuvers, it was determined that in response to the alleged Russian intervention, the forces of the NATO coalition would form and send an aircraft carrier strike group led by the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier to the combat area in order to “stop the invasion and preserve the sovereignty of Ukraine.” The context and scenario of the “exercise“ (the consonance of the names of countries, settlements, the names of political figures, the specifics of maneuvers, etc.) became for the Russian Federation a signal of the real preparation of NATO to the start of hostilities against Russia, as it happened similarly to the operation of the United Defender alliance grouping of forces before the intervention in Libya (the exercises Baltops-2010 and Frisian Flag-2010), when, after the maneuvers at the sea ranges, a full-scale operation followed to overthrow of the legitimate government of Muammar Gaddafi. POLARIS 2021 was also a demonstration of NATO support to Kyiv in the event of an armed conflict with Russia and was supposed to push Kyiv to start hostilities with the Russian Federation, after which the intervention of the NATO was supposed.In principle, NATO was looking for an excuse to attack Russia, with the factor of surprise, so that Russia would not be ready for an adequate response. In this situation, the preventive start of the Special Military Operation of the RF Armed Forces in Ukraine became the only possible response to the inevitable aggression of the Kyiv regime and the NATO. There is no doubt that thanks to the Russian special operation in Ukraine and the fact that Russia launched a preventive strike, it was NATO that was surprised but also scared by the Russian determination to defend its interests. It is precisely this fact that is responsible for why there was not and will not be conflict between Russia and NATO, that is, the Third World War was prevented only thanks to the Russian special operation in Ukraine.

Photo: Special Arrangement The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the Uttarakhand government not to proceed with the Pakhro tiger safari project inside the Corbett Tiger Reserve until the Central committee submits its final report on the alleged illegal cutting of trees inside the reserve for the project. The NGT Bench consisting of Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, Justice Sudhir Agarwal and professor A Senthil Vel (expert member) maintained that the Forest Survey of India (FSI) report on the matter clearly acknowledges the illegality in cutting of trees. “Thus, accountability needs to be fixed for such violations and the damage to the environment restored, following due process of law. Accordingly, we constitute a three-member committee comprising the Director Generals of the Forest Department, Wildlife Department and Project Tiger to identify the violators and the steps required for restoration of environment,” the NGT said. It further ordered the State government not to proceed with tiger safari project until the committee submits its report with specific recommendations that may be furnished to the Secretary of the Ministry of Forest, Environment and Climate Change within one month. The report should also include steps for further course of action in the matter, the green Bench ordered. Earlier, Anoop Singh, Director General of Forest Survey of India, in his report to the NGT, had maintained that the area of sites where the trees were cut — as mentioned in the letter from the Uttarakhand government — has been calculated using the GPS survey done by the geographic information system (GIS) team of the FSI and Google Earth imagery. “The number of trees observed per hectare from all the inventory plots when multiplied with the area figures of a particular site gives the number of estimated trees felled at that particular site. By adding the estimated trees at different sites, total estimated number of trees felled are arrived in the study area,” the FSI told the NGT. It added that the standard error of estimates has come out to be 10.31 trees, which is within the acceptable limit.

The decision was taken to give relief to people during Diwali and it was being done under the guidance of Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, he said. In a tweet on Saturday, AIMIM chief Owaisi said, \"In 2021, Gujarat saw 15,200 road traffic accidents in which 7,457 people lost their lives. This 'revdi' bonanza by BJP Gujarat govt is putting people's lives at risk.\" Sanghavi hit back on Saturday without naming anyone, saying those who doing politics over the issue will get a befitting reply from middle-class citizens (during polls). \"Middle-class citizens go out during Diwali to do shopping with their family with whatever they have saved during the year. Many also go out on their two-wheelers with their aged parents. People many times forget to wear helmets or carry a driving license. Instead of collecting fine, we will give them a flower to make them realise their mistake,\" the minister said in Surat. The intention was to ensure that people's \"Diwali does not get spoiled\" due to traffic fines, he said. \"On the other hand, we do not consider racing by bikers on roads a mistake. This is an intentional crime. Gujarat police very well knows the difference between unintentional mistake and crime. Surat police have caught many such bikers in the last few days. So no one needs to teach us anything on that,\" Sanghavi asserted. Govatsa Dwadashi, celebrated on Friday, marked the beginning of the Diwali festival this year. Laxmi Pujan, the main day of the festival of lights, will be celebrated on October 24. Meanwhile, at a function in Science City in Ahmedabad on Friday, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel inaugurated or performed ground breaking for 16,359 projects and works worth Rs 3,338 crore.

The functions came shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi kick-started the recruitment drive for 10 lakh people in the next one year with the induction of 75,000 youth on the eve of Diwali. The jobs are being given directly by 38 separate Central ministries/departments, or vide UPSC, Railway Recruitment Board and State Service Commissioners, with a simplified tech-enabled, speedy recruitment process. Goyal, Rane and Athawale handed over the recruitment letters to hundreds of selected candidates in the Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard, Indian Posts, Indian Railways, Armed Forces Medical College, CISF, RCF, MDL, ITD, CBIC, ESIC, several public sector, regional and rural banks, IIT-Bombay, BSF and other organisations. The three Central ministers urged the new recruits to work with dedication in their new assignments to ensure fulfilling the PM's dream of a developed India in the next 25 years. The Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi allies Congress, Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena (UBT) slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government's decision to \"wake up after eight-and-half years\" with an eye on the ensuing states elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Congress Chief Spokesperson Atul Londhe said that the government is making big hue and cry over the 'job jamborees' held on Saturday when the fact is that the recruitment examinations and process for most of these posts were completed over two years ago but the candidates were not hired for making political gains later. NCP's Chief Spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said that compared with the 2-crore jobs promised by Modi when he took power, what is actually being offered after over 8 years is a pittance, that too with political motives. Terming it as \"another big hoax and hogwash\", SS (UBT)'s Spokesperson Kishore Tiwari said for giving just 75K appointment letters, Modi has taken eight-and-half years, that too before the elections in Gujarat, Haryana and other states. \"Where are vacancies in the State and Central government with automations or outsourcing or selling off valuable public sector assets? The PM's assurance of 2 crore jobs every year for his tenure of 10 years comes to 20 crore jobs. It will take a century to fulfil his promise at the current speed. The government is fooling the masses before the state and Lok Sabha polls,\" Tiwari added. Londhe said that over 22-crore youth have registered for employment on the government's Shram portal of which only 700,000 have got jobs, while the CMIE has said more than 45 crore people have given up hopes for any job opportunities. The Congress leader also targeted Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' statement promising to create 72,000 jobs in the state, and said the (state) government is not capable of even giving 72 jobs. Today's 'Rozgar Mela' saw the participation of union and state ministers, elected leaders and other officials in different parts of India. --IANS qn/pgh (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/on-diwali-eve-800-maharashtra-youth-get-job-letters-mva-slams-bjp-govt/","tags":[],"title":"On Diwali-eve, 800 Maharashtra youth get job letters; MVA slams BJP govt"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Shah meets with BJP leaders, workers of Gujarat to review poll preparations Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday held a meeting with BJP leaders and workers of south Gujarat zone to review preparations for the upcoming state Assembly elections, dates of which are yet to be announced.

Talking to media persons here, Congress spokesperson Alka Lamba said unemployment and inflation are key issues among people in the state. She alleged there is \"infighting in BJP families\" over ticket distribution. \"I recently visited the Mandi region. BJP Minister Mahender Singh Thakur is an example of BJP practicing dynastic politics as his son has been given a ticket. Daughter of Mahinder Singh has opposed ticket distribution,\" she said. Mahender Singh Thakur's daughter resigned from the post of general secretary of the BJP Mahila Morcha after the BJP decided to field her brother from the Dharampur seat in Mandi district where she was also an aspirant. On the chief ministerial face, Alka Lamba said this will be decided by the party's central leadership after consultations. \"People and workers of the Congress want to see their leaders as Chief Minister. I was in Bilaspur, the workers want Ram Lal Thakur should be CM, in Mandi workers want Kaul Singh Thakurji as CM. There are many other leaders like Sukhuji, MukeshJi and Pratibha Singhji. The voters, MLAs and party high command will decide the face of the Chief Minister,\" Alka Lamba said. She also took potshots at BJP over denying tickets to some MLA. \"Why 11 MLAs were denied tickets. Now nothing will change by changing candidates. People of state have made their mind to change the government,\" she said. \"We honour those leaders of a family who raise the voice of people. We respect the emotions and feelings of the workers, we don't control them like BJP. Family politics is not an issue in these elections, the key issues are unemployment and inflation,\" she added. Alka Lamba, who has been actively involved in Congress campaign in Himachal Pradesh, said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will embark on the second leg of her campaign on October 31. \"Priyanka Gandhiji will hold a rally in Mandi and a roadshow in Kullu on October 31. So far, we have announced 63 candidates and a decision on five tickets will also be taken soon. The Congress will declare its star campaigners list after October 25. The party is also bringing out a charge sheet against the government. We shall release our manifesto soon,\" Alka Lamba said. She alleged that the government in Himachal Pradesh is \"being run from Delhi through remote control.\" \"The development works in the state were stalled for five years,\" she alleged. Asked about state Congress chief Pratibha Singh not embarking on a major campaign, she said the priority was to finalize candidates for all 68 Assembly segments and added that all leaders were campaigning. Himachal Pradesh will go for elections on November 12 and the counting of votes will take place on December 8.
