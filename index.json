In a dig, Thackeray said there is a downpour of announcements under the Eknath Shinde government and a \"drought\" in their implementation as he interacted with rain-hit farmers in Aurangabad district. He said the incumbent government loved to organise celebrations without bothering to see if people are happy and satisfied. The former chief minister was talking to reporters after visiting Pandharpur and Dahegaon villages in the Aurangabad district where retreating rain damaged crops. \"This state government is a celebration-loving government. There is an excess downpour of the announcement, whereas there is a drought in their implementation. Events should be celebrated but the government should see the people in the state are at least satisfied,\" he said. Thackeray said the state government must take efforts to change the relief criteria set by the National Disaster Response Fund as they have become outdated. He also said the state government should follow up with the Centre on the implementation of the 'Beed pattern' of crop insurance, also called the 80-110 formula. According to the supporters of the \"Beed pattern\", the formula gives benefits to farmers and the state by way of excess funds and to the insurer by capping the pay-outs. Calling his visit a symbolic one, Thackeray said the state government must declare \"wet drought\" in the state and provide Rs 50,000 per hectare as compensation to farmers affected by the rains. He said the state government must begin providing relief immediately instead of waiting for the loss assessment reports to be submitted from all areas. Speaking to PTI, farmer Kisanrao Dhonde (70) of Dahegaon in Gangapur tehsil said the heavy rains brought about by the retreating monsoons have destroyed his crops. \"My farm is spread over 6.5 acres. I had sown corn and cotton and harvest time was nearing. I had taken a loan of Rs one lakh to cover the cost of production. Now I won't even 30 per cent of this amount from the sale of whatever produce is left,\" he said. Dhonde, whose farm was visited by Thackeray, said his brinjal and okra cultivation has also rotted, leaving his family with a debt of Rs 3 lakh. \"I have no money to make repayments. The state government must help us,\" he said. Dahegaon sarpanch Vikram Raut said loss assessment surveys have not been completed as yet in the area and no aid from the government has reached people in the village so far. The Maharashtra cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to waive crop loans of a total of Rs 964.15 crore taken by farmers from land development banks. The assets and properties of land development banks will be transferred to the state government. The erstwhile Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by Thackeray in 2019 announced that those farmers who repay the crop loan on time will get an incentive. Initially, the amount was Rs 25,000, which was later revised to Rs 50,000. Now in opposition, Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress are demanding a declaration of wet drought in the state in the wake of retreating rain damaging crops of farmers.

Addressing the gathering, the Chief Minister said, \"Deepotsav of Ayodhya was started six years ago under the guidance and inspiration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . This festival of Uttar Pradesh has today become a festival of the country. A grand celebration of the sixth edition of Deepotsav is being held in Ayodhya, which is touching 'new heights of success.\" \"A city, which Lord Shri Ram himself has called 'glorious' (Janmabhoomi Mam Puri Suhavani, Uttar Dish Bah Saryu Pavni)', can never remain abandoned for so long. Deepotsav is now recognized as a significant celebration honoring the resolve of Ram Rajya\", he added. Prior to the Deepotsav event on Ram Ki Paidi, the symbolic coronation program of Lord Shri Ram was organized in Ramkatha Park, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Governor Anandiben Patel, both the Deputy Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh Brajesh Pathak and Keshav Prasad Maurya along with officials of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teeth Kshetra Trust and a large number of saints. \"Today, the entire city of Ayodhya is celebrating the arrival of Lord Shri Ram as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has realized the dream of Ramrajya in India through his resolve for the all-round development of the country and its people,\" CM Yogi said. Stating that a state where there is no room for misery and pain is defined as 'Ram Rajya' and the same is being witnessed by the country under the able leadership of the Prime Minister. The CM recited couplets of Goswami Tulsidas, \"Daihik Daivik Bhautik Taapa, Ramraj Naahi Kaahun Vyapa\", which means in the kingdom of Rama, there was no disease, no divine wrath, and no calamity. The Chief Minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a politician who has imbibed the ideals of Maryada Purushottam Lord Shri Ram and has been working dedicatedly for the last eight and a half years to realize the vision of Ram Rajya in the country. \"During the pandemic, the 135 crore Indians received free treatment, free vaccine, and free test while free ration was provided to 80 crore people without any discrimination. The schemes of the government are reaching every section of society including housing, toilets, electricity connections, and the Ayushman Bharat yojana among others. Yesterday itself the PM launched a program to provide jobs to about 10 lakh youths of the state,\" he said. The CM went on to say that India has witnessed massive infrastructure growth under the leadership and guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Yogi Adityanath said, \"The double-engine government is working for the welfare of every section without discrimination.\" The Chief Minister added, \"Today, a grand Shri Ram temple is being constructed in Ayodhya, as well as the grand Dham of Lord Vishwanath has been built in Kashi. The rejuvenation work of the 'Char Dhams' of Uttarakhand being carried out gives a feeling of pride to every Indian.\" He further remarked, \"Today the revival of Vindhyavasini Dham through the construction of a corridor is going on a war footing. Ramayana circuit, Krishna circuit, Buddhist circuit, or restoration work of Shakti Peethas across the country is going on under the leadership of PM. All these are attempts to honor India's rich heritage.\" The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is aiming to advance India's development in line with Lord Shri Ram's objectives, he concluded.

During India's chase of 160, the Men in Blue had a poor start, losing four wickets for just 30 runs. The last time India played Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, which was last year in Dubai, the Indians ended up in the losing side, which was their first-ever defeat to these opponents in a World Cup game. Therefore, there was a sigh of relief on Kohli and Co's faces on Sunday when Ravichandran Ashwin hit the winning runs. \"It's a surreal atmosphere, I have no words, no idea how that happened. I am really lost for words. Hardik believed we can do it, if we stayed till the end. When Shaheen bowled from the pavilion end, that's when we decided to take him down. Haris is their prime bowler, and I hit those two sixes. The calculation was simple. Nawaz had one over to bowl, so if I could take Haris down, they would panic,\" said Kohli after he received the Player of the Match award.At a loss for words… Wouldn't have preferred anyone else with me out there @imVkohli 👑🫡 One of the best games of my life 🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/jWge1qy5lj— hardik pandya (@hardikpandya7) October 23, 2022 Kohli also mentioned that Hardik, with whom he put up 113 runs for the fifth wicket, kept pushing him. It was the highest partnership for India against Pakistan for any wicket in T20Is.\"From 28 in 8, it came down to 16 to 6. I tried to stick to my instincts. The first one was the back of a hand slower ball (the one over long-on). Standing here I just feel like it was meant to be. Till today Mohali was my best innings against Australia. Today I will count this one higher. Hardik kept pushing me. The crowd has been phenomenal. You guys (fans) kept backing me and I am grateful for your support,\" added Kohli. Meanwhile, with his latest knock, Kohli also surpassed Rohit Sharma in the list of most runs in T20Is. Kohli is the leading run-scorer in the shortest format on the international level with 3,794 runs in 110 games at a strike rate of 138.41 and an average of 51.97. Kohli has hit 34 fifties and a century, which came earlier this year in the Asia Cup.

The recent development around Charles Barkley’s contract with TNT provided a sigh of relief for fans of the award-winning show Inside the NBA. Earlier this year, the former MVP had caused quite a storm with rumors of him holding talks with LIV Golf, who reportedly offered him a fortune. An avid golfer, Barkley maintained that for him to leave TNT, he’d expect a ridiculous offer numbers-wise. Fortunately, for fans of Inside the NBA, The Chuckster wasn’t made a formal offer. Not wanting to keep Turner in limbo, the 59-year-old signed a massive deal with the network. The way the deal is structured, if TNT retains the rights to the NBA, Barkley’s deal goes for another 7 years.https://t.co/Kq3hESbyMU — Andrew Marchand (@AndrewMarchand) October 17, 2022 A 10-year contract meant Chuck wasn’t going anytime soon, given he had in the past voiced his desire to retire from the show once his two-year contract expired. “We’re all a big family — Ernie, Kenny and Shaquille are brothers to me — and I wouldn’t still be here if it wasn’t for them and all the amazing people who work on our show,” Barkley told New York Post. “I’m not gonna lie, though, this is a life-altering deal … and I’m blessed to be able to do live television for a living.” Also read: “Just Wait Until This Guy Finds Out About Stand Up Comedy”: NBA Twitter Reacts to Charles Barkley’s 10-year Contract with TNT During a recent appearance on the Dan Patrick Show, Barkley would at length discuss his new contract with TNT.

Sending social media abuzz with his recent signing, Barkley would narrate the entire happenings of the event. “I just want to thank my TNT family, I’ve got a great company I work for, so I’m excited to be back with TNT and looking forward to the future,” said the eleven-time All-Star. When asked if the LIV Golf negotiations affect his contract with TNT, Barkley answered, “Zero Percent.” “TNT asked me, we need something from you, would you give us something and I said, ‘what do you want?’ they’re like we need you to stay longer, we can’t lose you, and be it on the NBA.” Barkley revealed the producers wanted him to stay for at least 3-years and that they were going to bid on the NBA. When asked if he could sign for a couple of more years, the veteran forward said the following. “Well you guys have been great to me, I’ll stay on a couple of more years, and I mean there’s probably zero chance, I’m gonna stay for the entire 10 years.” Speaking about his meeting with Turner, The $60 million worth Barkley said “I met with Turner personally, I’m not worried about money at this stage of my life. Listen, if I don’t have money by now, I’m a big idiot. I mean, I played 16 years in the NBA, and this is my 22nd year starting the night on Turner.” Whatever may be the case, this serves as great news for fans of Inside the NBA, given the show would never be the same without him. Charles Barkley is a laugh riot. Sir Charles is one of the most entertaining personalities in the history of American sports broadcasting. Every word that the TNT analyst says on-air can constitute promo shots. The Alabama native has changed the landscape of sports broadcasting with his bold nature.

As the tournament moves on with the ‘Super 12’ teams, South Africa will take on Zimbabwe in the third match of the ‘Super 12 Group 2’ on Monday, at the Blundstone Arena, in Hobart. Zimbabwe, on the back of couple of wins during the group/qualifying stage earlier, managed to make it through to the next round, with their batting allrounder Sikander Raza proving to be their match-winner on both these occasions.

SA vs ZIM pitch report Blundstone Arena The Bellerive Oval or the Blundstone Arena at Hobart, has already hosted a few matches during the qualifying stage of the World Cup earlier. The Proteas pace battery might well dictate terms during the contest tomorrow, as the fast bowlers at this venue have scalped 31 wickets in this year’s World Cup so far, at a strike rate of 14.4 during the night matches. With overcast conditions also expected during match time, expect the pacers to make further inroads, thereby making it a bit challenging for the batters. The average score across the seven matches this World Cup so far at this venue, has been 153.4 runs, which might well turn out to be a match-winning total after batting first. “The surface seems to be true, it is a solid track. Sri Lanka would want to bat first. There will be a bit of bounce and spin, maybe 160 would be par. The game within the game would be how the teams play against the shorter boundary with the breeze,” remarked former Australian pacer Dirk Nannes about the pitch at this venue, during the previous match here between Ireland and Sri Lanka today.

In fact, maintaining your passwords and data is more vital than ever as we become a more tech-reliant society. Today, I’m going to show you how to manage your Google Passwords like a pro and why you may want to check in on them frequently. We may make this into a series in the future to show you how to manage your other online accounts to maintain your safety and privacy, but today, we’re going for the big one. Why it’s important Our society is ripe with people who would seek to take advantage of those who are less tech-literate or savvy about how online accounts and information work. Luckily, Google has created the Safer with Google initiative . Here, they teach you a ton of great tips and tricks and even give you the tools you need to stay safe as you and your family browse online. One specific area I want to highlight, of course, is your passwords. Google Passwords is a one-stop shop for adding, modifying and removing saved passwords for any website you visit in the Chrome browser. By visiting Google Passwords on the web, you can let Google automatically tell you what needs to be changed or fixed to make your accounts ironclad. How to perform a Password Checkup The Password Checkup tool can be launched using the blue button below. One you arrive at the destination, a blue “Check Passwords” button will be waiting for you. Clicking it will have several benefits! First and foremost, it will show you how many and which of your online accounts are utilizing “compromised” passwords. These are items you should consider changing the password for immediately as they have likely suffered from a data breach, where your personal information was stolen from that company by a third party or otherwise exposed publicly. You can also check for such breaches at haveibeenpwned . Launch Password Checkup Compromised Passwords As you can see, prior to cleaning all of this up, I had 49 compromised passwords! That’s pretty scary, but the truth is that data breaches happen practically every week nowadays, and it’s a risk of using digital services. That’s not to say it should be accepted, but you should check back on the Password Checkup tool frequently to watch for them. Pro Tip: You can install the Google Password Alert extension from the Chrome Web Store to be notified when entering your password on any website. This will allow you to determine whether or not your data is safe. Fair warning though, it’s super annoying when it redirects you each time you enter your password on sites you trust, but it can be turned off for that site pretty easily! Duplicate or shared passwords The next section on the checkup tool tells you how many passwords are being reused or shared across different online accounts. Ideally, every website you visit should use a completely unique and different password, and this is much easier when Chrome auto-fills across both the browser and mobile. However, the truth is that the cultural operation of passwords has been nearly entirely dependent on the human brain – the most fallible and weakest link in the chain. Social engineering relies on humans to slip up or to create patterns, and hackers take these opportunities to figure out what your password may be. In other words, if they discover your password for one site, they can almost be sure it’s your password for another site or many others. The screenshot above is a very old one, and I’ve had it saved for a while, so luckily, I’m not sharing the same password across 553 sites anymore. Instead, I let Chrome randomly generate secure passwords for each of them and also let it store them on my behalf. I recommend doing this to avoid patterns! Weak Passwords Lastly, the “Weak Passwords” section shows you how many and which of your online accounts is using a password that’s not as secure as it could be. Normally, having a password be at least 8 characters with a capital letter, lower case letters, numbers, symbols, and so on strengthens it and makes it harder for an opportunist to guess, even with tools like hash tables. Once again, if you’re having trouble coming up with unique passwords that meet these criteria, you can allow Chrome to auto-generate something for you that fits the bill. I can’t stress this enough! If you’re worried about not being able to sign in on another device, make sure that said device has your Google Account synchronizing to it so that your passwords will be detected and injected into form fields automatically! As Google seeks to kill the password entirely, this entire ordeal may not be necessary anymore, but passwords themselves are a product of a bygone era (or rather one that’s passing before our very eyes!) In due time, the word “password” will be a joke we tell our grandkids, but the idea of safety and online security with privacy tools that account protection will never be a thing of the past. Change your passwords often The common consensus for how often you ought to freshen up your passwords and change them to something new is generally every three months. There may be circumstances like the aforementioned data breaches and so on that cause you to consider changing them even more frequently. If there is a data breach on a website and Google informs you, you should take time to change that account’s password immediately! My advice to you is to visit the Google Password Checkup tool once every two to three months and simply go through all three sections until the check marks are no longer red or yellow but green. If you’re not a fan of Google Passwords, then I recommend you use something like Dashlane, One Password, or Lastpass (but never lose your master password or you’ll lose access to all of the passwords in the vault!) Knowledge is half the battle My last word of wisdom to you is to avoid storing passwords for your bank, Google Account, or any other online presence you maintain on paper, in a Keep note, or another plain text editor, or really anywhere else. It may be more convenient, but it can be something you regret for a long time to come if you become a victim of cybercrime! You don’t have to be like me who creates all of his passwords in other languages, or like those super techy individuals who create randomized strings of characters and memorizes them, but by utilizing the tools at your disposal and keeping up with the technology, you can maintain a safe online presence for you and your family without also constantly dealing with the headache of them.

The family of the deceased, Niharika, accused her husband and his family of killing her after harassing her repeatedly. According to the police, Niharika got married to Karthik five years ago. It was a love marriage and both families were opposed to it initially. Soon after the marriage, Karthik’s family allegedly started harassing her. Unable to bear the harassment, Niharika returned home during Dasara holidays. However, Karthik got Niharika back home recently and promised to take care of her, the police said. On Saturday, Niharika called her sister to inform her that she had been harassed again. Inquiries revealed that Niharika was harassed over a trivial row about a school programme she wanted to attend, the police said. Shivalingaradhya, Niharika’s father, accused Karthik and his family of killing her. Based on a complaint, the police have registered a case against the accused, charging them under dowry harassment, abetment to suicide.

It wasn’t an open-box delivery like some of the items on Flipkart, but the buyer did share an OTP with the delivery person since the box looked just fine. However, when the main Flipkart packaging was opened, the Asus box inside was tampered and the barcodes and product details were removed. When the box was opened, there was everything but a laptop. It had old computer parts and e-waste along with a stone, which was apparently kept to keep the box heavy. As soon as this was learned by the buyer, he raised a return request which wasn’t approved by the seller. When the matter was known by Flipkart, it contacted the seller, however, the seller responded that the product was intact. Now, the buyer, Chinmaya, is in hopes that Flipkart investigates the issue as soon as possible and returns or refunds him. “I reported the same to Flipkart on the same day with all the proofs. They answered me that they need some time to get back with solution. On 23rd October they emailed me that the seller rejected the return request and the product is not at all damaged during the transportation,” said the buyer Chinmaya.

NOLA fans can expect Zion to be a focal point during the Pels-Hornets clash, as he is expected to suit up on Sunday night. Unlike Kira Lewis Jr. (Out), E.J. Liddell (Out), and Jaxson Hayes (Questionable), Zion isn’t mentioned on the team’s injury report. Can NOLA go 3-0? The Pelicans haven’t disappointed yet. In the first two clashes, Brandon Ingram and co. have not yet trailed at any point. In the last 25 years, the Pels are only the fifth team to do so. The Pelicans are the fifth team in the last 25 years not to trail at any point in their first two regular season games, per @ESPNStatsInfo.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by New Orleans Pelicans (@pelicansnba) In the bout against the Charlotte-based franchise, the highflyer put up 16 points in 31 minutes. NOLA fans can expect Zion to be a focal point during the Pels-Hornets clash, as he is expected to suit up on Sunday night. Unlike Kira Lewis Jr. (Out), E.J. Liddell (Out), and Jaxson Hayes (Questionable), Zion isn’t mentioned on the team’s injury report. Can NOLA go 3-0? The Pelicans haven’t disappointed yet. In the first two clashes, Brandon Ingram and co. have not yet trailed at any point. In the last 25 years, the Pels are only the fifth team to do so. The Pelicans are the fifth team in the last 25 years not to trail at any point in their first two regular season games, per @ESPNStatsInfo. The other four teams: – 2011-12 Hawks – 2004-05 Jazz – 2004-05 Heat – 1997-98 Hawks — Andrew Lopez (@_Andrew_Lopez) October 22, 2022 The big four of the Pels have been sensational so far. Agreed two games is a small sample space, however, averaging 92 PPG out of NOLA’s 127, must be satisfactory for Willie Green. pic.twitter.com/aWl8NK9SRl — Andrew Lopez (@_Andrew_Lopez) October 22, 2022 To be honest, it’ll be pretty easy for JV and “Zanos” to dominate the paint and boards while going up against the likes of Lauri Markkanen and Kelly Olynyk. There is a huge possibility that we see the New Orleans-based franchise grab the win on Sunday.

Sonia Gandhi was running the UPA government and the NGOs with extra constitutional authority, he claimed, alleging that these private bodies received patronage from the then ruling dispensation as several ministries and Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) donated them huge amount of money. Even the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund meant for help in disasters and accidents donated to the RGF, he noted. \"The Gandhi family is present wherever there is corruption,\" Patra alleged. These dynasts enjoyed perks of power without responsibility and accountability, he said.

The investigators covered alleged manipulation of documents while filing income-tax returns, misuse of funds and money laundering while receiving funds from foreign countries, including China.

Ahead of the Gujarat Assembly polls due later this year, AAP national convener Kejriwal has visited the state multiple times in the recent past to garner support for his party. Addressing a gathering after a firecrackers show organised here on Saturday, Gujarat BJP chief Paatil said, \"Today I read some news that the chief minister of Delhi has imposed a ban on firecrackers in Delhi. That brother is trying to come here (for?? elections in Gujarat). Then how will you burst firecrackers?\" \"So please recognise such anti-religious people and against firecrackers who stop us from celebrating our festivals,\" Paatil said. The Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government had said the ban on crackers was imposed on the orders of Supreme Court and the BJP leaders were showing disrespect to the court. BJP leaders had targeted the Delhi government over the complete ban on firecrackers, dubbing the Kejriwal-led dispensation \"anti-Hindu\". BJP MP Manoj Tiwari recently said Chief Minister Kejriwal should allow people in Delhi to burst crackers for two-three hours on Diwali. The AAP has been trying to position itself as the main contender to the ruling BJP in Gujarat where elections are due later this year. Kejriwal has anchored his party's campaign around a slew of guarantees like 300 units of free electricity per month, free education in government schools, sops for unemployed youth, Rs 1,000 allowance to women and a monthly stipend for new lawyers.

Things were smooth for Vijayan from 2016, when he first took over as the new chief minister and things remained the same even when Arif Mohammed Khan - a surprise choice by the national BJP leadership - was appointed the Governor in 2019. A seasoned politician, 70-year-old Khan who has travelled across quite a few political parties, starting from age 26, in a short time had won the hearts of many a Keralite through his affable and friendly approach and had no airs of the highly decorative post of his. But Khan first raised eyebrows when two years back he threatened not to read out adverse remarks about the Narendra Modi government, but later he changed his stand. From then on, it was a different Khan one saw, especially when it came to issues with the Vijayan government. He was at odds over the position taken by the Vijayan government on the Citizenship Amendment Act and from then on it was a series of tussles with Khan, giving headaches to the state government. He soon got the tag of being the principal 'opposition party' replacing the Congress led UDF. Then came the issue of the reappointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor Gopinath Ravindran and after coming down heavily on it, Khan quietly inked the reappointment. He then blew hot over the appointment of Priya Varghese, wife of Vijayan's private secretary K.K. Ragesh, to a teaching job in the same university and he put his foot down. When the Kerala High Court took a similar stand, it gave Khan an edge in his tiff with the Vijayan government. In between he made a scathing attack on the way personal staff members were appointed and even though he promised to take strict action, so far nothing has happened. And things got more bitter when he refused to ink the controversial tweaking of the Lok Ayukta Ordinance, forcing Vijayan to call a special sitting of the legislature. Khan is presently sitting on the Bill. If these issues were not enough, recently Khan dismissed 15 nominated senate members of Kerala University after they, despite being warned to be present at a crucial senate meeting, did not turn up. Khan also warned the state ministers not to speak disparagingly about him and threatened that it could lead to the withdrawal of his 'pleasure', clearly implying that if they continue in the same manner such ministers might be booted out. Vijayan however maintained a stoic silence, but came down heavily early his week when he said the rights, responsibilities and duties of the Governor are clearly mentioned in the Constitution as are those of the ministers. Even B. R. Ambedkar, the principal architect of India's Constitution, has said the powers of the Governor are very narrow and the apex court has also clarified that the Governor should work according to the directions of the cabinet. \"Everything is clearly written and when such a situation is there, can anyone say otherwise,\" added Vijayan. To a question on the way Khan dismissed 15 senate members of Kerala University, he said what he has done is not tenable under the law and moreover the common principle of extending natural justice was also not adhered to. But state Congress president K. Sudhakaran, the biggest opponent of Vijayan, said there are very valid points raised by Khan. \"One needs to assess things which he has raised and all what he has raised just cannot be dismissed. There is merit in certain things that he has taken up with the state government,\" said Sudhakaran. State BJP president K. Surendran also did not lose any opportunity to take on Vijayan and also the Congress and pointed out that when it comes to attacking Khan, who was appointed by the Centre, these two political parties are hand in glove. The BJP will defend Khan, as he has done nothing wrong. --IANS sg/bg (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/blog/guv-arif-keeps-blowing-hot-but-cm-pinarayi-says-this-is-kerala/","tags":[],"title":"Guv Arif keeps blowing hot, but CM Pinarayi says 'This is Kerala'"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"No end in sight to tug-of-war between Jharkhand Governor, Soren govt The role of Syed Sibte Razi had sparked intense controversy in 2005 when he administered the oath of chief ministership to Shibu Soren, the leader of the UPA\nTen Governors have been appointed in Jharkhand since it came into existence as a state about 22 years and 11 months ago. Of these, the tenure of Syed Sibte Razi, who was Governor between 2004 and 2009, and Ramesh Bais, the 10th Governor, will be remembered for political controversies. The role of Syed Sibte Razi had sparked intense controversy in 2005 when he administered the oath of chief ministership to Shibu Soren, the leader of the UPA, instead of the leader of the single largest party, the BJP, after the assembly election results. Soren had to resign after nine days as he was not able to prove his majority and then Arjun Munda was sworn in as CM. The tenure of the current Governor Ramesh Bais began on July 7, 2021. During his tenure of nearly one and a half years till now, there have been reports of differences, tensions and disagreements between Raj Bhavan and the state government on at least three-four occasions. For the past two months, a political tug of war has been going on between Governor Ramesh Bais and Chief Minister Hemant Soren over a letter from the Election Commission of India. This sealed letter reached Raj Bhavan in Ranchi from New Delhi on August 25. This letter is related to deciding the eligibility-disqualification of Chief Minister Hemant Soren, but even after 59 days it has not been officially disclosed what is the text of this letter. Soren and the state's ruling coalition have alleged that political uncertainty and confusion have been created due to non-disclosure of this letter. On the other hand, the Governor has publicly said that it is his discretion when and what decision he will take on this letter. No one should question this. The letter pertains to a case related to Hemant Soren's Office of Profit and alleged violation of the Representation of the People Act. Soren had taken a stone quarry on lease with an area of 88 decimils in his name in Anagada in Ranchi while being the Chief Minister. However, no mining work took place there and later Soren surrendered the lease. The BJP had complained to the Governor calling it a case of violation of the Office of Profit and Representation of the People Act. The Governor had sought the opinion of the Election Commission on this. The commission issued notice to the complainant and Hemant Soren and sought their response in this matter. After hearing both the sides, the Election Commission had sent its decision in a sealed cover to the Raj Bhavan on August 25. Unofficially, news has been doing the rounds that the Election Commission has recommended the cancellation of Hemant Soren's assembly membership considering him guilty and because of this he may lose his Chief Minister's chair. Amid the political suspense and confusion created by such reports, the ruling coalition had to undertake 'dinner diplomacy' and 'resort stay' to express solidarity with Hemant Soren . The ruling coalition also passed a motion of trust in Soren's favour in a special session of the assembly. Despite all this, the Governor has not yet revealed the contents of the letter and due to this the Hemant Soren government is going through a period of uncertainty about its future. On September 15, Soren met Bais and demanded that he clarify the situation regarding the letter of the Election Commission. He told the Governor that there is an atmosphere of uncertainty in the state. In such a situation, being the constitutional head of the state, he should take appropriate steps to protect democracy and the Constitution. The Chief Minister also requested the Governor in writing to provide him a copy of the decision sent by the Election Commission regarding his membership of the Assembly and the matter should be heard at the earliest. No response has been received from the Governor on this request so far. After this, on October 8, Vinod Pandey, the general secretary of the ruling party JMM, asked for a copy of the letter of the Election Commission by giving an application under the Right to Information Act at the Raj Bhavan. Along with the application, he also submitted a postal order of Rs 10. No response has been received on this as well. About a month ago, when asked what is in the letter of the Election Commission and when will it be opened, the Governor while avoiding the question in a light-hearted manner said that the envelope which has come from the Election Commission is stuck so hard that it is not opening. On October 15, Hemant Soren while talking to reporters at CM House said, \"I am the first Chief Minister of the entire country, who is going from the door of the Election Commission to the Governor, urging them to say if I have committed any crime, then what punishment has been given to me for it? I am asking him time and again that if I am really guilty, then how am I continuing in the post of Chief Minister?\" Hemant Soren also questioned the credibility and transparency of constitutional institutions by naming the Governor during the same press conference. He said that the way the central agencies are working, it seems that there is some power behind them, whose behest they are compelled to follow. Governor Ramesh Bais has raised questions many times in the last eight-ten months on the decisions of the government to the bills passed by the government in the assembly. In February, the Governor had raised many questions on the rules made by the state government regarding the formation of the Tribal Advisory Council (TAC). Bais had complained to the Centre saying that the rules made by the state government in June 2021 are contrary to the constitutional provisions and encroachment on the powers of the governor. He returned the TAC's manual and the file related to its formation to the state government and asked for changes in it. Even after months, there is a deadlock between the Raj Bhavan and the government on this matter. In the last few months, the Governor has returned half a dozen bills including the Anti-Mob Lynching Bill and the Krishi Mandi Bill passed by the state government in the Assembly. Recently, he also returned the bill passed by the government regarding the increase in court fees for reconsideration. During the review of the functioning of the tourism, cultural development, sports and youth affairs department last week, the governor expressed dissatisfaction and even remarked that a lack of vision was evident in the state. Overall, it can be said that there are many chapters yet to be written in the script of tension and confrontation between the Raj Bhavan and the state government in Jharkhand . --IANS snc/uk/bg (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/blog/no-end-in-sight-to-tug-of-war-between-jharkhand-governor-soren-govt/","tags":[],"title":"No end in sight to tug-of-war between Jharkhand Governor, Soren govt"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Tussle between Punjab Governor, AAP govt over Ludhiana VC turns murkier The latest in a series of confrontations is Governor Purohit's directive to CM Bhagwant Mann to remove Satbir Singh Gosal from the post of Ludhiana-based Punjab Agricultural University Vice-Chancellor\nAn 'escalating tussle' between the constitutional head and the democratically elected Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Punjab has turned murkier with the former reminding the government that he took an oath to protect the Constitution and will not allow violation of rules. Without mincing words, Governor Banwarilal Purohit reminded the Bhagwant Mann-led government that in the past one year he didn't utter one word against any person. Rather he has been praising the Chief Minister. The latest in a series of confrontations is Governor Banwarilal Purohit's directive to Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann to remove Satbir Singh Gosal from the post of Ludhiana-based Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Vice-Chancellor. In a letter to the Chief Minister, the Governor termed Gosal's appointment as \"totally illegal\", saying he was appointed by the state government \"without following UGC norms and approval of the Chancellor\". The Governor is the chancellor of the PAU, the country's premier agricultural university established in 1962. The previous \"tussle\" between the duo was over the appointment of cardiologist Gurpreet Wander as Vice Chancellor of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, with the Governor saying the government violated the rules by recommending only one name. Wander later withdrew his candidature as Vice Chancellor. Justifying his decision to ask the government to withdraw the appointment of Gosal as Vice-Chancellor of the PAU, Purohit on Friday told the media in a formal interaction at Raj Bhavan that as the Chancellor of the universities he is performing his duty. \"Rather the government is interfering in his functioning. \"I will perform my duty. I have taken an oath to protect the Constitution. The Chief Minister should realise this. In fact, I administered the oath of office to the Chief Minister. He should not forget that.\" A day earlier the Chief Minister in a letter accused the Governor of \"constantly interfering\" in the government's functioning. Missing no opportunity to take a dig at the AAP government, currently facing Opposition pressure to drop cabinet minister Fauja Singh Sarari on corruption charges, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) said the government has played fraud with the constitutional head of the state as well as Punjabis by sending a letter to the Governor in English but releasing its forged and fabricated version in Punjabi on social media. SAD former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said the fraud had been perpetrated in the name of the Chief Minister along with his signature. \"The Chief Minister should disclose whether he was party to this act and whether it had his acquiescence. If not then the Chief Minister should get an FIR registered in the case and institute a high-level probe into the entire matter. \"Since the issue is also one of constitutional propriety, the SAD also urges the Governor to direct the Chief Minister to order an independent inquiry into the issue and ensure exemplary punishment for those guilty of forging documents as well as their dissemination.\" Cheema said the fact that neither the Chief Minister nor the AAP government had issued a clarification on the issue despite the matter being pointed out by the Governor himself indicated that the AAP was playing politics on the issue. The letter written by the Chief Minister to the Governor in Punjabi justifies the appointment of the PAU Vice-Chancellor. The signed letter, in circulation with the media, says the appointment of Gosal was done in accordance with the Punjab and Haryana Agricultural University Act of 1970. The Chief Minister said the appointment was the prerogative of the PAU board. Hence the Chief Minister or the Governor have no role. \"For the past few months, you have been constantly interfering in the functioning of the government, which was elected with a huge mandate. People of Punjab are very upset because of this,\" the letter quoting Mann said. Raj Bhavan responded on October 20 by clarifying that \"there is a letter in circulation in the media. This letter has not been received in Punjab Raj Bhavan till this moment\". However, it says, the letter received is in English and the contents of both the letters are materially different. Raj Bhavan has sought a clarification from the Chief Minister as to which of his two letters is authentic and why the letter written in Punjabi has been circulated to the media before and without sending it to Punjab Raj Bhavan. A day after the Governor asked the government to remove Gosal, Agriculture Minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal defended the appointment and accused the Governor of interfering in the government's functioning. Dhaliwal told the media here that the order of the Governor challenging the appointment was 'illegal' and said the appointment was made following all norms. Accusing the Governor of acting at the behest of the BJP, he said the Governor is taking unconstitutional action and his letter sent to the government was actually drafted at the BJP headquarters in Delhi. The minister said the AAP government would not tolerate any interference in its work. Dhaliwal said the PAU comes under the Haryana and Punjab Agriculture University Act 1970 and it does not come under the University Grants Commission. He said before taking any action, the Governor should have read the university Act and if it is an 'illegal appointment' then he should clarify why the post of the Vice Chancellor has been vacant for one year. \"The Governor is violating the dignity of his constitutional office. If he wants to do politics then there are elections in Gujarat and Himachal, he must contest elections there,\" Dhaliwal said. He added that the government appointed the two most deserving candidates for the post of two Vice Chancellors but both were objected to by the Governor, which clearly shows that he doesn't want the AAP to function for the development of Punjab and its people. Earlier, the 'rift' between the Governor and Chief Minister Mann was the former taking strong exception to the absence of the Chief Minister at the civic reception organised by him in honour of visiting President Droupadi Murmu. Reminding the Chief Minister of his constitutional obligations that have to be met on such occasions, the Governor, in the presence of President Droupadi Murmu, had said publicly from the stage: \"I had personally called him (Chief Minister) up, but he has not come apparently due to some compulsion.\" \"Whatever the compulsion, the constitutional obligations are more important and have to be fulfilled on such an occasion.\" Mann was also conspicuously absent at the Indian Air Force's 90th Air Show here on that day as he was on a political tour to poll-bound Gujarat along with AAP national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Earlier, the government took exception to the Governor's decision to seek details of legislative business for the Assembly session beginning on September 27. \"I want to ask the Governor to check the record of his office and tell the people how many governors have asked the government to provide information about the purpose of summoning an assembly session. Till today, no governor did it. Only he is doing so, because he is working at the behest of the BJP,\" Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema had said. Responding to the purported 'war of words', the Governor in a missive to the Chief Minister had said, \"Perhaps your opinion about me will definitely change after reading the provisions of Article 167 and 168 of the Constitution, which I'm quoting for your ready reference.\" Chief Minister Mann had clarified that the Governor or President's consent before any session of the legislature is a formality. \"In 75 years, no President or Governor ever asked list of legislative business before calling a session. Legislative business is decided by BAC (Business Advisory Council) and speaker. Next Governor will ask for all speeches also to be approved by him. It's too much,\" Mann had tweeted.

However, the actual implementation would come when the fresh batch of MBBS students begins in November. Three text books in Hindi have been released paving the way for its implementation. Since the day the three MBBS text books were released by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Bhopal, the implementation of this project has started a debate on the entire education system in Madhya Pradesh . The promotion of Hindi through its wider use has been a programme under the BJP government at the Centre as well as in Madhya Pradesh . The New Education Policy-2020 (NEP-2020) lays emphasis on the use of the mother tongue in imparting education. The Congress has questioned the timing of the project as the assembly elections in the state are scheduled in November-December 2023. The opposition has also questioned the implementation of the Hindi medium engineering courses. In 2016, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government started an engineering course in Hindi at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Hindi University in Bhopal. Technical engineering terms were translated from English to Hindi for the purpose. The programme found few takers, and the Congress claims the course has been discontinued. Medical Education Minister Vishwas Sarang, who is monitoring the project, countered the allegations claiming that implementation of Hindi in engineering and medical courses has put paid to the concept that technical and medical courses can only be in the English language. \"There was a fixed concept in mind that medical study can be done in English only, which has now started changing. We have introduced Hindi for engineering courses and the work is still underway, the time will come when people will accept it. These are things which cannot come overnight,\" Sarang said. Dr Vijalaxmi Sadho, who was medical education minister in the Kamal Nath-led Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and is an alumni of Gandhi Medical College, on being asked whether the MBBS course in Hindi is being implemented as a pilot project, accepted that students who come from a Hindi medium background face challenges. However, she believes that the government should have laid more emphasis on improving the education system at the school level, especially in the rural areas of the state. Talking exclusively to IANS, Sadho said, \"Our basic education system is poor and therefore implementation of Hindi or any other language would not achieve its real purpose until the children are imparted quality education. The Shivraj government said that exams should not be conducted for students upto the 9th class. Doing this you have ended a competitive system. In the rural areas, there are several students who have passed their primary level but they can't even write their name. That is why I would say that the government should focus on providing quality education, until then no concept will work.\" She alleged that around 1500 primary and secondary schools were closed in the last few years. She claimed that during the Congress rule between 1993 to 2003, the state had established thousands of primary and secondary schools at a distance of every three to five km. \"The Shivraj government closed over 1500 schools and now CM Rise schools are being established. There is a shortage of teachers at every school in Madhya Pradesh and the same situation prevails in government-run colleges and universities,\" Sadho added. She accused the BJP government of creating a conflict between Hindi and English for its political benefit. \"The BJP has been in power for the last 17 years and it never focused on improving the education system. Now, when the elections are getting closer, they are trying to divert attention from the real issues to hide their failure.\" Sadho, who was also a member of the Department of Public Health in Madhya Pradesh from 1993 to 1998, said, \"I accept that students who have studied in Hindi medium schools face difficulties when they come for higher education, especially in technical and medical courses, but this problem won't end with the introduction of Hindi. The only way to find a solution is to improve school education.\" --IANS pd/bg (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/blog/bjp-pushes-mbbs-in-hindi-madhya-pradesh-congress-questions-timing-of-move/","tags":[],"title":"BJP pushes MBBS in Hindi; Madhya Pradesh Congress questions timing of move"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Did NATO Plan A Pre-Emptive Strike On Russia Polaris 21 - The French Maritime Exercise that saw participation of 24 ships, one submarine, 65 aircraft and 6000 personnel with partners from Europe and USA The post Did NATO Plan A Pre-Emptive Strike On Russia appeared first on N4M (News4masses).\nOne of the largest French maritime exercises in the Mediterranean, POLARIS 21 (Préparation Opérationnelle en Lutte Aéromaritime, Résilience, Innovation et Supériorité), took place from November 18 to December 3, 2021 in the area west of the island of Corsica, between France and Spain. The exercise also included a segment on the Atlantic coast of mainland France. POLARIS 21 was set up entirely in the context of operational preparation on several fronts and had a high combat intensity, which was fully in line with the strategic vision of the Chief of the Armed Forces and the Mercator Acceleration 21 plan of the Chief of Staff of the Admiral of the French navy Pierre Vandier. In addition to naval warfare, the exercise also included the participation of many combat aircraft and surface-to-air defense. Officially, the aim of the training was to test the capabilities of the sea and air elements to face future wars, using the latest systems and naval vessels to develop tactics. The scenario of the exercise was to “enable the Allies to maintain control of the Mediterranean in the event of threat from the Russian air force and navy”. Polaris 2021 “Exercise” The exercise scenario consisted of two troops (Blue and Red), BLUE consisting of the French Carrier Strike Group (CSG), centered around the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier FS Charles de Gaulle (R91), against a RED FORCES credible opposition force ( OPFOR), gathered around the Mistral-class left-hand drive ‘Tonnerre’. In total, the exercise saw the participation of 23 ships, one submarine, 65 aircraft and 6,000 personnel. Partner nations joining the exercise came from Greece, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The United States Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Porter (DDG 78), P-8A Poseidon aircraft from Commander, Task Force 67, and the Henry J. Kaiser-class fleet replenishment oiler USNS John Lenthal (T-AO 189) had a very important place in the “exercise“ POLARIS 2021. Also, U.S. Sixth Fleet, headquartered in Naples, Italy, conducted the full spectrum of joint and naval operations, often in concert with NATO partners, in order to strengthen the power of U.S. in Europe and Africa. The actual goal of the exercise However, journalists came into possession of data related to the exercise POLARIS 2021. The data speak clearly about the advance preparation of the NATO to enter into an armed conflict with the Russian Federation in the event of Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. According to the legend of the maneuvers, it was determined that in response to the alleged Russian intervention, the forces of the NATO coalition would form and send an aircraft carrier strike group led by the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier to the combat area in order to “stop the invasion and preserve the sovereignty of Ukraine.” The context and scenario of the “exercise“ (the consonance of the names of countries, settlements, the names of political figures, the specifics of maneuvers, etc.) became for the Russian Federation a signal of the real preparation of NATO to the start of hostilities against Russia, as it happened similarly to the operation of the United Defender alliance grouping of forces before the intervention in Libya (the exercises Baltops-2010 and Frisian Flag-2010), when, after the maneuvers at the sea ranges, a full-scale operation followed to overthrow of the legitimate government of Muammar Gaddafi. POLARIS 2021 was also a demonstration of NATO support to Kyiv in the event of an armed conflict with Russia and was supposed to push Kyiv to start hostilities with the Russian Federation, after which the intervention of the NATO was supposed.In principle, NATO was looking for an excuse to attack Russia, with the factor of surprise, so that Russia would not be ready for an adequate response. In this situation, the preventive start of the Special Military Operation of the RF Armed Forces in Ukraine became the only possible response to the inevitable aggression of the Kyiv regime and the NATO. There is no doubt that thanks to the Russian special operation in Ukraine and the fact that Russia launched a preventive strike, it was NATO that was surprised but also scared by the Russian determination to defend its interests. It is precisely this fact that is responsible for why there was not and will not be conflict between Russia and NATO, that is, the Third World War was prevented only thanks to the Russian special operation in Ukraine.

Many also go out on their two-wheelers with their aged parents. People many times forget to wear helmets or carry a driving license. Instead of collecting fine, we will give them a flower to make them realise their mistake,\" the minister said in Surat. The intention was to ensure that people's \"Diwali does not get spoiled\" due to traffic fines, he said. \"On the other hand, we do not consider racing by bikers on roads a mistake. This is an intentional crime. Gujarat police very well knows the difference between unintentional mistake and crime. Surat police have caught many such bikers in the last few days. So no one needs to teach us anything on that,\" Sanghavi asserted. Govatsa Dwadashi, celebrated on Friday, marked the beginning of the Diwali festival this year.

The functions came shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi kick-started the recruitment drive for 10 lakh people in the next one year with the induction of 75,000 youth on the eve of Diwali. The jobs are being given directly by 38 separate Central ministries/departments, or vide UPSC, Railway Recruitment Board and State Service Commissioners, with a simplified tech-enabled, speedy recruitment process.

The three Central ministers urged the new recruits to work with dedication in their new assignments to ensure fulfilling the PM's dream of a developed India in the next 25 years. The Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi allies Congress, Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena (UBT) slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government's decision to \"wake up after eight-and-half years\" with an eye on the ensuing states elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.

Terming it as \"another big hoax and hogwash\", SS (UBT)'s Spokesperson Kishore Tiwari said for giving just 75K appointment letters, Modi has taken eight-and-half years, that too before the elections in Gujarat, Haryana and other states. \"Where are vacancies in the State and Central government with automations or outsourcing or selling off valuable public sector assets?

Talking to media persons here, Congress spokesperson Alka Lamba said unemployment and inflation are key issues among people in the state. She alleged there is \"infighting in BJP families\" over ticket distribution. \"I recently visited the Mandi region. BJP Minister Mahender Singh Thakur is an example of BJP practicing dynastic politics as his son has been given a ticket. Daughter of Mahinder Singh has opposed ticket distribution,\" she said. Mahender Singh Thakur's daughter resigned from the post of general secretary of the BJP Mahila Morcha after the BJP decided to field her brother from the Dharampur seat in Mandi district where she was also an aspirant. On the chief ministerial face, Alka Lamba said this will be decided by the party's central leadership after consultations. \"People and workers of the Congress want to see their leaders as Chief Minister. I was in Bilaspur, the workers want Ram Lal Thakur should be CM, in Mandi workers want Kaul Singh Thakurji as CM. There are many other leaders like Sukhuji, MukeshJi and Pratibha Singhji. The voters, MLAs and party high command will decide the face of the Chief Minister,\" Alka Lamba said. She also took potshots at BJP over denying tickets to some MLA. \"Why 11 MLAs were denied tickets. Now nothing will change by changing candidates. People of state have made their mind to change the government,\" she said. \"We honour those leaders of a family who raise the voice of people. We respect the emotions and feelings of the workers, we don't control them like BJP. Family politics is not an issue in these elections, the key issues are unemployment and inflation,\" she added. Alka Lamba, who has been actively involved in Congress campaign in Himachal Pradesh, said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will embark on the second leg of her campaign on October 31. \"Priyanka Gandhiji will hold a rally in Mandi and a roadshow in Kullu on October 31. So far, we have announced 63 candidates and a decision on five tickets will also be taken soon. The Congress will declare its star campaigners list after October 25.

She alleged that the government in Himachal Pradesh is \"being run from Delhi through remote control.\" \"The development works in the state were stalled for five years,\" she alleged.
