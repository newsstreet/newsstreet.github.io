During India's chase of 160, the Men in Blue had a poor start, losing four wickets for just 30 runs. The last time India played Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, which was last year in Dubai, the Indians ended up in the losing side, which was their first-ever defeat to these opponents in a World Cup game. Therefore, there was a sigh of relief on Kohli and Co's faces on Sunday when Ravichandran Ashwin hit the winning runs. \"It's a surreal atmosphere, I have no words, no idea how that happened. I am really lost for words. Hardik believed we can do it, if we stayed till the end. When Shaheen bowled from the pavilion end, that's when we decided to take him down. Haris is their prime bowler, and I hit those two sixes. The calculation was simple. Nawaz had one over to bowl, so if I could take Haris down, they would panic,\" said Kohli after he received the Player of the Match award.At a loss for words… Wouldn't have preferred anyone else with me out there @imVkohli 👑🫡 One of the best games of my life 🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/jWge1qy5lj— hardik pandya (@hardikpandya7) October 23, 2022 Kohli also mentioned that Hardik, with whom he put up 113 runs for the fifth wicket, kept pushing him. It was the highest partnership for India against Pakistan for any wicket in T20Is.\"From 28 in 8, it came down to 16 to 6. I tried to stick to my instincts. The first one was the back of a hand slower ball (the one over long-on). Standing here I just feel like it was meant to be. Till today Mohali was my best innings against Australia. Today I will count this one higher. Hardik kept pushing me. The crowd has been phenomenal. You guys (fans) kept backing me and I am grateful for your support,\" added Kohli. Meanwhile, with his latest knock, Kohli also surpassed Rohit Sharma in the list of most runs in T20Is. Kohli is the leading run-scorer in the shortest format on the international level with 3,794 runs in 110 games at a strike rate of 138.41 and an average of 51.97. Kohli has hit 34 fifties and a century, which came earlier this year in the Asia Cup. Rohit, who managed just four off eight balls, has scored 3,741 runs in 143 games, including four centuries and 28 fifties.\nthehansindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/blog/virat-kohli-after-helping-india-beat-pakistan-my-best-innings-till-date/","tags":["Sports,Top Stories,Cricket"],"title":"Virat Kohli after helping India beat Pakistan: 'My best innings till date'"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"“I’m Not Worried About Money at This Stage of my Life”: Charles Barkley Reveals Exquisite Details of Meeting with Turner Post Signing Potential $200 Million Deal NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley explains at length what got him to sign a 10-year contract with TNT that could fetch him close to $200 million.

The recent development around Charles Barkley’s contract with TNT provided a sigh of relief for fans of the award-winning show Inside the NBA. Earlier this year, the former MVP had caused quite a storm with rumors of him holding talks with LIV Golf, who reportedly offered him a fortune. An avid golfer, Barkley maintained that for him to leave TNT, he’d expect a ridiculous offer numbers-wise. Fortunately, for fans of Inside the NBA, The Chuckster wasn’t made a formal offer. Not wanting to keep Turner in limbo, the 59-year-old signed a massive deal with the network. The way the deal is structured, if TNT retains the rights to the NBA, Barkley’s deal goes for another 7 years.https://t.co/Kq3hESbyMU — Andrew Marchand (@AndrewMarchand) October 17, 2022 A 10-year contract meant Chuck wasn’t going anytime soon, given he had in the past voiced his desire to retire from the show once his two-year contract expired. “We’re all a big family — Ernie, Kenny and Shaquille are brothers to me — and I wouldn’t still be here if it wasn’t for them and all the amazing people who work on our show,” Barkley told New York Post. “I’m not gonna lie, though, this is a life-altering deal … and I’m blessed to be able to do live television for a living.” Also read: “Just Wait Until This Guy Finds Out About Stand Up Comedy”: NBA Twitter Reacts to Charles Barkley’s 10-year Contract with TNT During a recent appearance on the Dan Patrick Show, Barkley would at length discuss his new contract with TNT. Charles Barkley gives an insight into his contract discussion with Turner. Sending social media abuzz with his recent signing, Barkley would narrate the entire happenings of the event. “I just want to thank my TNT family, I’ve got a great company I work for, so I’m excited to be back with TNT and looking forward to the future,” said the eleven-time All-Star. When asked if the LIV Golf negotiations affect his contract with TNT, Barkley answered, “Zero Percent.” “TNT asked me, we need something from you, would you give us something and I said, ‘what do you want?’ they’re like we need you to stay longer, we can’t lose you, and be it on the NBA.” Barkley revealed the producers wanted him to stay for at least 3-years and that they were going to bid on the NBA. When asked if he could sign for a couple of more years, the veteran forward said the following. “Well you guys have been great to me, I’ll stay on a couple of more years, and I mean there’s probably zero chance, I’m gonna stay for the entire 10 years.” Speaking about his meeting with Turner, The $60 million worth Barkley said “I met with Turner personally, I’m not worried about money at this stage of my life. Listen, if I don’t have money by now, I’m a big idiot. I mean, I played 16 years in the NBA, and this is my 22nd year starting the night on Turner.” Whatever may be the case, this serves as great news for fans of Inside the NBA, given the show would never be the same without him. Charles Barkley is a laugh riot. Sir Charles is one of the most entertaining personalities in the history of American sports broadcasting. Every word that the TNT analyst says on-air can constitute promo shots. The Alabama native has changed the landscape of sports broadcasting with his bold nature. Nevertheless, he’s one of the most endeared celebrities on television.

Those two guys (Kohli and Pandya) are experienced. Staying calm and taking the game deep was very critical. Good for our confidence. Always crucial to get off the mark like this.

All credit to Kohli and Pandya. It wasn't easy with the new ball. We had partnerships after 10 overs. We had a chance. We tried to stick to our plans. But credit to Virat Kohli. In the middle we decided we wanted a wicket and held the spinner back. We had a lot of positives. The way Iftikhar played and the way Shan played,\" said Babar.

As the tournament moves on with the ‘Super 12’ teams, South Africa will take on Zimbabwe in the third match of the ‘Super 12 Group 2’ on Monday, at the Blundstone Arena, in Hobart. Zimbabwe, on the back of couple of wins during the group/qualifying stage earlier, managed to make it through to the next round, with their batting allrounder Sikander Raza proving to be their match-winner on both these occasions. ALSO READ: Bangladesh versus Netherlands tomorrow’s Super 12 match pitch report However, apart from him and Craig Ervine, none of the other batters in their line-up have managed to impress so far, which might hurt them big time against a quality South African attack tomorrow. As for South Africa, who recently lost the three-match away T20I series against India, will for certain be the favourites to win tomorrow’s contest, with eyes on their pace bowling attack, at the fast, bouncy pitches Down Under. SA vs ZIM pitch report Blundstone Arena The Bellerive Oval or the Blundstone Arena at Hobart, has already hosted a few matches during the qualifying stage of the World Cup earlier. The Proteas pace battery might well dictate terms during the contest tomorrow, as the fast bowlers at this venue have scalped 31 wickets in this year’s World Cup so far, at a strike rate of 14.4 during the night matches. With overcast conditions also expected during match time, expect the pacers to make further inroads, thereby making it a bit challenging for the batters. The average score across the seven matches this World Cup so far at this venue, has been 153.4 runs, which might well turn out to be a match-winning total after batting first. “The surface seems to be true, it is a solid track. Sri Lanka would want to bat first. There will be a bit of bounce and spin, maybe 160 would be par. The game within the game would be how the teams play against the shorter boundary with the breeze,” remarked former Australian pacer Dirk Nannes about the pitch at this venue, during the previous match here between Ireland and Sri Lanka today.

In fact, maintaining your passwords and data is more vital than ever as we become a more tech-reliant society. Today, I’m going to show you how to manage your Google Passwords like a pro and why you may want to check in on them frequently. We may make this into a series in the future to show you how to manage your other online accounts to maintain your safety and privacy, but today, we’re going for the big one. Why it’s important Our society is ripe with people who would seek to take advantage of those who are less tech-literate or savvy about how online accounts and information work. Luckily, Google has created the Safer with Google initiative . Here, they teach you a ton of great tips and tricks and even give you the tools you need to stay safe as you and your family browse online. One specific area I want to highlight, of course, is your passwords. Google Passwords is a one-stop shop for adding, modifying and removing saved passwords for any website you visit in the Chrome browser. By visiting Google Passwords on the web, you can let Google automatically tell you what needs to be changed or fixed to make your accounts ironclad. How to perform a Password Checkup The Password Checkup tool can be launched using the blue button below. One you arrive at the destination, a blue “Check Passwords” button will be waiting for you. Clicking it will have several benefits! First and foremost, it will show you how many and which of your online accounts are utilizing “compromised” passwords. These are items you should consider changing the password for immediately as they have likely suffered from a data breach, where your personal information was stolen from that company by a third party or otherwise exposed publicly. You can also check for such breaches at haveibeenpwned . Launch Password Checkup Compromised Passwords As you can see, prior to cleaning all of this up, I had 49 compromised passwords! That’s pretty scary, but the truth is that data breaches happen practically every week nowadays, and it’s a risk of using digital services. That’s not to say it should be accepted, but you should check back on the Password Checkup tool frequently to watch for them. Pro Tip: You can install the Google Password Alert extension from the Chrome Web Store to be notified when entering your password on any website. This will allow you to determine whether or not your data is safe. Fair warning though, it’s super annoying when it redirects you each time you enter your password on sites you trust, but it can be turned off for that site pretty easily! Duplicate or shared passwords The next section on the checkup tool tells you how many passwords are being reused or shared across different online accounts. Ideally, every website you visit should use a completely unique and different password, and this is much easier when Chrome auto-fills across both the browser and mobile. However, the truth is that the cultural operation of passwords has been nearly entirely dependent on the human brain – the most fallible and weakest link in the chain. Social engineering relies on humans to slip up or to create patterns, and hackers take these opportunities to figure out what your password may be. In other words, if they discover your password for one site, they can almost be sure it’s your password for another site or many others. The screenshot above is a very old one, and I’ve had it saved for a while, so luckily, I’m not sharing the same password across 553 sites anymore. Instead, I let Chrome randomly generate secure passwords for each of them and also let it store them on my behalf. I recommend doing this to avoid patterns! Weak Passwords Lastly, the “Weak Passwords” section shows you how many and which of your online accounts is using a password that’s not as secure as it could be. Normally, having a password be at least 8 characters with a capital letter, lower case letters, numbers, symbols, and so on strengthens it and makes it harder for an opportunist to guess, even with tools like hash tables. Once again, if you’re having trouble coming up with unique passwords that meet these criteria, you can allow Chrome to auto-generate something for you that fits the bill. I can’t stress this enough! If you’re worried about not being able to sign in on another device, make sure that said device has your Google Account synchronizing to it so that your passwords will be detected and injected into form fields automatically! As Google seeks to kill the password entirely, this entire ordeal may not be necessary anymore, but passwords themselves are a product of a bygone era (or rather one that’s passing before our very eyes!) In due time, the word “password” will be a joke we tell our grandkids, but the idea of safety and online security with privacy tools that account protection will never be a thing of the past. Change your passwords often The common consensus for how often you ought to freshen up your passwords and change them to something new is generally every three months. There may be circumstances like the aforementioned data breaches and so on that cause you to consider changing them even more frequently. If there is a data breach on a website and Google informs you, you should take time to change that account’s password immediately! My advice to you is to visit the Google Password Checkup tool once every two to three months and simply go through all three sections until the check marks are no longer red or yellow but green. If you’re not a fan of Google Passwords, then I recommend you use something like Dashlane, One Password, or Lastpass (but never lose your master password or you’ll lose access to all of the passwords in the vault!) Knowledge is half the battle My last word of wisdom to you is to avoid storing passwords for your bank, Google Account, or any other online presence you maintain on paper, in a Keep note, or another plain text editor, or really anywhere else. It may be more convenient, but it can be something you regret for a long time to come if you become a victim of cybercrime! You don’t have to be like me who creates all of his passwords in other languages, or like those super techy individuals who create randomized strings of characters and memorizes them, but by utilizing the tools at your disposal and keeping up with the technology, you can maintain a safe online presence for you and your family without also constantly dealing with the headache of them.

The family of the deceased, Niharika, accused her husband and his family of killing her after harassing her repeatedly. According to the police, Niharika got married to Karthik five years ago. It was a love marriage and both families were opposed to it initially. Soon after the marriage, Karthik’s family allegedly started harassing her. Unable to bear the harassment, Niharika returned home during Dasara holidays. However, Karthik got Niharika back home recently and promised to take care of her, the police said. On Saturday, Niharika called her sister to inform her that she had been harassed again. Inquiries revealed that Niharika was harassed over a trivial row about a school programme she wanted to attend, the police said. Shivalingaradhya, Niharika’s father, accused Karthik and his family of killing her. Based on a complaint, the police have registered a case against the accused, charging them under dowry harassment, abetment to suicide. (Those in distress or those having suicidal tendencies can call Arogya Sahayavani Ph.: 104 for help.)

Upon arrival, he opened the box only to know that he has received a box full of e-waste and old computer parts. Just like some of us, he had only seen such frauds happening on social media platforms but witnessed it in real for the first time. Flipkart Plus user gets a giant stone and e-waste when ordered a gaming laptop On October 15th, Chinmaya ordered a gaming laptop, the Asus TUF Gaming F15, for his friend since he had a Flipkart Plus membership. The product was delivered on October 20, seal-packed from the outside. It wasn’t an open-box delivery like some of the items on Flipkart, but the buyer did share an OTP with the delivery person since the box looked just fine. However, when the main Flipkart packaging was opened, the Asus box inside was tampered and the barcodes and product details were removed. When the box was opened, there was everything but a laptop. It had old computer parts and e-waste along with a stone, which was apparently kept to keep the box heavy. As soon as this was learned by the buyer, he raised a return request which wasn’t approved by the seller. When the matter was known by Flipkart, it contacted the seller, however, the seller responded that the product was intact. Now, the buyer, Chinmaya, is in hopes that Flipkart investigates the issue as soon as possible and returns or refunds him. “I reported the same to Flipkart on the same day with all the proofs. They answered me that they need some time to get back with solution. On 23rd October they emailed me that the seller rejected the return request and the product is not at all damaged during the transportation,” said the buyer Chinmaya. This isn’t the first time that such scams are happening. Recently, a person ordered a laptop from Flipkart in the Big Billion Days sale but he received a detergent soap.
