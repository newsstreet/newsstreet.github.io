That won’t stop anytime soon, but I feel like this deal on the Pixel 6a may not be eclipsed even by the wildness of Q4 price cuts. With an MSRP of $449, a drop of $150 is a pretty big deal for any piece of tech, and in this particular case, the Pixel 6a isn’t just some random phone. While it surely isn’t a perfect phone, it does hit a lot of high notes for a mid-ranger. With the same Tensor SoC as the Pixel 6, a stellar camera experience and the look/feel of the Pixel 6 line of phones, the Pixel 6a is a solid purchase at its full $449 MSRP. However, we know price cuts are part of the mid-range smartphone game, and the Pixel 6a has already had a few discounts along the way. We’ve seen it hit this exact $299 price point, actually, but it required purchase through a carrier and activation. This time around, that’s not the case. For an unknown amount of time, the Pixel 6a can be yours outright for $299 from a few places. Target, Amazon and the Google Store are all participating in the offer, so you are free to order online or hop over to your local Target store and simply pick one up. All three stores are carrying all three colors, but it looks like Target might be sold out of the Sage color at the moment. Shop Pixel 6a on Chrome Shop Other discounts on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro It is also worth noting that you can get the Pixel 6 for $499 or the Pixel 6 Pro for $649 via carrier deals at the moment as well. While these are definitely not the lowest prices we’ve seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, it is worth taking a look at these devices if you’d like a bit more RAM, storage or higher refresh screen options. I’d say the Pixel 6 is likely worth the $200 upgrade over the Pixel 6a at these prices, but if your budget says otherwise, the Pixel 6a is still a solid phone. While we’ve seen better deals on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro in the past, they required carrier activation. These current deals from Best Buy, Target and Amazon don’t carry any such requirements, so they should be in the conversation if you are looking at the Pixel 6a. In a recent conversation with a co-worker, it became clear to me pretty quickly that for most users, the benefits to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are minimal when compared to the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Sure, there are upgrades, but the price gap between the two is pretty monumental with sales like these, so it’s worth considering the Pixel 6a, Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro right now for many of you. But act quickly: these things tend to disappear before you know it.

All-rounder Marcus Stoinis has provided a shot in the arm to Australia’s ICC T20 World Cup 2022 campaign via a match-winning half-century against Sri Lanka in the seventh Super 12 match at the Optus Stadium tonight. Chasing a 158-run target, defending champions Australia had failed to gain any advantage in the powerplay on the back of scoring 33/1 under fielding restrictions. While the run-chase was first given some acceleration by all-rounder Glenn Maxwell (23), it was Stoinis’ power-packed knock which propelled them to not just a victory but a significant improvement in their NRR (Net Run Rate) as well. Stoinis, who scored 59* (18) with the help of four fours and six sixes at a strike rate of 327.77, registered a second T20I half-century to win a maiden Player of the Match award in his 49th match. Shoaib Akhtar compliments Marcus Stoinis for scoring fastest 50 in T20 international among Australian batters Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar took to social media platform Twitter to express approval of Stoinis’ innings. Returning from an injury in the tournament, Stoinis winning a match on his own is an ideal-case scenario for this Australian middle-order. Wow, @MStoinis you beauty! What an inning. — Shoaib Akhtar (@shoaib100mph) October 25, 2022 Coming in to bat at No. 5 in the 13th over, Stoinis dominated in a 25-ball 69-run fourth-wicket partnership finishing the match with 21 deliveries to go. The same was possible on the back of a brutal display of batting in Perth. Having hit a boundary on the third delivery that he faced, Stoinis hit two more fours in the following Dasun Shanaka over. Taking on the attack against the Sri Lankan spinners, the right-handed batter smashed a four and as many as five sixes in the next two Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana overs. Having scored the second-fastest half-century (17 balls) in a T20 World Cup, the 33-year old player also managed to register the fastest T20I half-century among Australian batters.

Stephen Curry demolished any doubts surrounding his legacy last season. His playoff performance was nothing short of magic. The shooting wizard took down some fearsome opponents and won his fourth championship. His brilliance also helped him bag his first-ever Finals MVP. Through his campaign, Curry has found a surprising supporter in Kevin Garnett. The Boston Celtics legend is convinced of Steph’s greatness. He is mesmerized by his game, by his spirit. And he believes that the Baby-Faced Assassin is solely responsible for usurping LeBron James’ era. Also read: “LeBron James, Same Sh*t Like Adam Levine”: Sofia Franklyn Reveals How Lakers Star Uses NDAs to Cheat on Savannah James Stephen Curry is the flag bearer of the three-point era In an episode of KG Certified, Garnett discussed the current era of basketball and made an astute observation. The Hall of Famer claimed that LeBron James’ era was over. His statement essentially means that LeBron isn’t the best player in the league anymore. Not MVP or even Finals MVP. Those two awards shouldn’t be seen as the markers of the best player in the league. And Kevin Garnett definitely understands that demarcation. Instead, KG claimed that it was now the era of Stephen Curry. He took note of how the Warriors superstar had changed the game. Garnett praised Stephen Curry for his long-range shooting. The way he has changed the game and made the defense acknowledge the threat of long-range shooting. Effectively, Curry stretched the three-point line way too close to the half-court line. Steph took over a league that was once ruled by athletic big men. So, KG believes that we must give the 6’2″ PG more respect. And he also wants us to understand that with LeBron James’ era ending, there is no doubt about Steph’s legacy. View this post on Instagram A post shared by KG: Certified (@kgcertified) Will Curry win more titles than LeBron James? Steph is on a mission. A mission that started last season. With a scoring title behind him, Curry started the 2021-22 season on an 18-2 win streak. The momentum spilled right into the playoffs. Curry carried the Dubs on his shoulders to their 4th rin in 8 years. This season seems similar. He has already registered three games with 30+ points and he has made at least 4 threes every game. James Wiseman’s addition to the lineup has also given GSW an added big man. Stephen Curry definitely can realistically win his 5th ring this year. If he does, he will have won more championships than LeBron James and Shaquille O’Neal. That would change how the world perceives him. Also read: Is Klay Thompson Playing Tonight vs Suns?

The company is opening its first Nothing Store on 4 Peter Street in London's fashion-oriented Soho neighborhood sometime \"before Christmas\" this year. The company is promising a \"boutique\" rather than the usual tech shop experience, and touts design flourishes inspired by classic chains like Italy's Olivetti.The store will offer all of Nothing's currently small lineup, including the Phone 1, Ear 1 and upcoming Ear Stick. To no one's surprise, there will be incentives to line up for opening day — you can get free merch and buy one of 100 limited edition Ear Sticks.The store is a gamble for a two-year-old startup competing against heavyweights in audio and mobile, some of which (such as Apple and Samsung) have much larger retail presences. While Nothing's store won't be big, it's also sitting in one of the posher parts of London. Where the average retail rent in the city is about £64 per square foot, Soho's is estimated at just under £150. That's a lot to spend when it's unclear how customers will respond.This strategy is familiar, mind you. Apple has long focused on opening stores in high-traffic (and sometimes iconic) locations to catch the eyes of shoppers who wouldn't otherwise browse technology, and other companies have used similar approaches. Nothing Stores could theoretically make the brand more recognizable, not to mention reinforce its style-oriented image.\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/a-store-that-sells-nothing-will-open-in-london-this-year/","tags":["Shopping","site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Jon Fingas"],"title":"A store that sells Nothing will open in London this year"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Amit Shah meets BJP leaders from Saurashtra ahead of Gujarat polls Union Home Minister and senior BJP leader Amit Shah on Tuesday met party leaders from the Saurashtra region of Gujarat to formulate strategy for the coming Assembly elections in the state.

It’s the validation of a longstanding rumor that the UK’s public broadcaster was looking to move the show from its traditional distribution network.Back in July, Bloomberg reported that Disney was looking for “established” brands to bolster its streaming platform. The world’s longest-running science-fantasy series, with its own global fanbase, certainly counts as a big draw for any global streamer.Naturally, new series of Doctor Who will continue to air on the BBC’s own channels and streaming platform, iPlayer, in the UK and Ireland. The series will return in November 2023 with a run of specials to celebrate the show’s 60th anniversary, followed by a new series in 2024.At the same time, the BBC has announced a new logo and branding that will feature on the show when it returns in 2023, as well as its vast catalog of merchandise. The new logo is a 21st century update of the classic “diamond” logo, designed by Bernard Lodge in 1973.It's one of the most recognizable images in the show's long history, and while the diamond's shelf-life in the series proper stretched from 1973 to 1980 (for all but one year of Tom Baker's Tenure) — it was also plastered on merchandise from the early '70s all the way through to 1996. (Ironically, it was supplanted by a revamped version of the show's 1969-1974 logo.)Back in 2018, the BBC recruited branding agency LittleHawk to revitalize the show’s image with a look covering both its Classic and New Series eras. The fact that, so quickly afterward, the show has opted to switch back to an older look stands as a repudiation of LittleHawk’s work. Not to mention the fact it’ll cause much consternation to the buyers of the show’s flagship Collection Blu-Ray boxsets. Who will, once again, have to deal with an inconsistent run of spines running along their shelves and are, arguably, the real victims in all of this.\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/future-doctor-who-seasons-will-air-on-disney/","tags":["site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Daniel Cooper"],"title":"Future ‘Doctor Who’ seasons will air on Disney+"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Coimbatore district reports eight new COVID-19 cases thehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/coimbatore-district-reports-eight-new-covid-19-cases/","tags":[],"title":"Coimbatore district reports eight new COVID-19 cases"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Tech giant Apple urges global supply chain to decarbonise by 2030 Apple exhorted its global supply chain to decarbonise by 2030, as the tech giant said it will evaluate the work of its major manufacturing partners to decarbonise their Apple-related operations\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/tech-giant-apple-urges-global-supply-chain-to-decarbonise-by-2030/","tags":[],"title":"Tech giant Apple urges global supply chain to decarbonise by 2030"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Champions League: Vital to book last 16 place before final game, says Tottenham’s Conte Victory against Sporting Lisbon will guarantee a place in the last 16 for Tottenham.\nsportstar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/champions-league-vital-to-book-last-16-place-before-final-game-says-totte/","tags":[],"title":"Champions League: Vital to book last 16 place before final game, says Tottenham’s Conte"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Texas Natural Gas Prices Go Negative Yesterday, Waha natural gas sank to near zero levels.

The company’s new foldable phone is set to release in select European markets almost three months after its China debut. According to GSMArena, the 8GB RAM and 256GB storage option of the foldable phone, which is still only available in Satin Black, will retail for 1,200 euros, which is roughly Rs 98,500. Although Motorola has not yet made the availability date public, those keen can anticipate hearing about it soon enough. The company also did not say anything about the India release of the new Moto Razr 2022. If launched in India, the Moto Razr 2022 would take on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4, which folds the same way as the Razr 2022. The Galaxy Z Flip 4 starts at Rs 89,999 in India. The Razr 2022 features a 6.7-inch FHD+ OLED foldable screen with a 144Hz refresh rate. The chin from the earlier Razr versions has been eliminated, and the hinge mechanism has been reworked. Additionally, the phone comes with a 2.7-inch OLED cover screen that users can use to access most of the functionality without having to unfold the main screen, the report added. You get Android 12-based MyUX on the Razr 2022, and the company has not said anything about future software updates. The Motorola Moto Razr 2022 features a 50-megapixel main camera with OIS and a 13-megapixel ultrawide module. On the main display, there is a 32-megapixel camera housed inside the punch-hole on the top. The new Moto Razr 2022 comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, as we mentioned. However, the 8GB/128GB and 12GB/512GB variants don’t seem to be included in the initial global release, according to the report. There is no support for a microSD card on the phone. The Motorola Moto Razr 2022 includes a 3,500mAh battery with 30W charging, eSIM + physical SIM slot, IP52 splash rating, and dual speakers with Dolby Atmos. — Edited excerpts from IANS The post Motorola Moto Razr 2022 flip phone arrives in Europe, India launch likely appeared first on BGR India.\nbgr\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/motorola-moto-razr-2022-flip-phone-arrives-in-europe-india-launch-likely/","tags":["Mobiles","News","moto razr 2022 launch","Moto Razr 2022 price","Motorola Moto Razr 2022"],"title":"Motorola Moto Razr 2022 flip phone arrives in Europe, India launch likely"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Coca-Cola beats profit estimates in Q3, raises full-year guidance The company said it now sees organic revenue growth of 14% to 15% for the full year.

In an article published in the scientific journal PNAS, Umeå researcher Fredrik Almqvist and his colleagues present a new type of antibiotic that effectively kills hard-to-fight bacteria.\nBacterial resistance to antibiotics is a growing threat to human health. In an article published in the scientific journal PNAS, Umeå researcher Fredrik Almqvist and his colleagues present a new type of antibiotic that effectively kills hard-to-fight bacteria. This is the start of a new class of antibiotic substances that work on many bacteria associated with healthcare-associated infections, such as VRE and MRSA.\" Fredrik Almqvist. Professor, Department of Chemistry, Umeå University Fredrik Almqvist is a professor at the Department of Chemistry at Umeå University and has been researching new alternatives to antibiotics since the late 1990s. Effective antibiotics are crucial for saving lives in areas such as surgery, cancer treatment and intensive care, but also for treating common diseases such as chlamydia or pneumonia. But as antibiotic resistance increases, the clock is ticking for the scientific community. \"Antibiotic resistance is listed by the WHO as one of the planet's greatest challenges. It's being talked about as being on a par with the climate threat,\" says Fredrik Almqvist. Studies conducted at Umeå University and Washington University in St. Louis could be an important piece of the puzzle in the fight against dangerous bacteria. The new class of antibiotics, which the researchers call GmPcides, fights so-called Gram-positive bacteria. According to the studies, they are effective on their own, but also enhance their effectiveness when combined with existing antibiotics. \"This is the fruit of a long collaboration between chemists and molecular biologists in Umeå and the team in St. Louis led by Professor Scott Hultgren. It's a privilege to work with so many fantastic researchers,\" says Fredrik Almqvist. The research shows that the GmPcides cannot only stop bacteria from dividing, but also kill bacteria that are not growing. Something that other antibiotics often struggle to do. Fredrik Almqvist is very hopeful about the results published in the prestigious journal PNAS. \"This is a first step, a new class that has exciting properties, and now of course we are working to develop these into something that can also help people in the future. Our goal is to come up with a substance to which bacteria do not easily become resistant.\" Umeå University Nye, T.M., et al.

For his Ph.D. thesis, Emad Ibrahim used methods and practices from digital signal processing and machine learning to generate new solutions hosted on edge platforms. Applications hosted on an edge platform require resource-aware strategies to fit a certain algorithm in the limited storage and processing budget of the edge devices. In his Ph.D. research, Emad Ibrahim used methods, practices, and processes of both digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML), with the intention of generating new solutions at the system level where DSP techniques improve the ability of ML models to converge on an optimized solution. Ultrasonic gestures Any edge device requires also a means of control. Acoustics from commercially off-the-shelf (COTS) sensor components can be used as a means for contactless control via in-air ultrasonic gestures and/or speech. The core brain for such control is a systematic combination of DSP and ML techniques. In-air ultrasonic gestures are hand gestures that are detected by first transmitting an ultrasound signal from a device and then extracting useful information from the received echoes. This can be of great value in devices that lack enough space to host physical buttons. The combination of low-cost speech recognition with ultrasonic gesture recognition opens the door for innovative applications in consumer electronics. Ultrasonic definitions use the Doppler shift due to hand (object) motion as a building block, where its variations in time and space construct unique detectable patterns. Some edge devices have space to accommodate only one sensor, while others have more space to host multiple sensors. Each of these scenarios can have a different computation flow that requires further research for optimum performance where Ibrahim and his colleagues explore and recommend different applications. One such application presented in Ibrahim's work is a Virtual Proximity Detector (VPD) that can be used to robustly detect proximity in smartphones using solely the ultrasound band in the built-in speaker. Another application is detecting hand gestures using a small-form factor sensor array that is small enough to be embedded in consumer electronics such as smart speakers.

In addition, the lack of prognostic markers is a significant impediment to personalized treatment.\nMalignant tumors in the head and neck region are very heterogeneous and therefore difficult to treat. In addition, the lack of prognostic markers is a significant impediment to personalized treatment. A joint study by MedUni Vienna and the Christian Doppler Laboratory for Applied Metabolomics focused on the development and identification of specific markers to improve risk assessment for patients. The study was published in the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging. So far, only limited research has been done on the genetic characteristics of the extremely diverse tumors in the head and neck region. There are also no suitable parameters for risk assessment in high-risk patients. This is the context for the recent study conducted by the research team led by Lukas Kenner from MedUni Vienna's Clinical Institute of Pathology and Alexander Haug from MedUni Vienna's Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine in cooperation with the Christian Doppler Laboratory for Metabolomics and its corporate partner Siemens Healtheneers. Based on DNA sequencing of 127 tissue samples from affected patients, the researchers analyzed the cellular characteristics of the tumors using artificial intelligence (AI) and positron emission tomography (PET) as an imaging method. The aim of the retrospective study (lead author Clemens Spielvogel) was to calculate specific numbers that can be used as markers for risk assessment in patients by combining the data from the genetic analysis and imaging. First, the DNA from the tissue sections was sequenced, the three-dimensional PET images of the patients were evaluated, and specific image patterns extracted. The research team then merged the data using machine learning algorithms to identify genetic networks with different patterns of disruption in the tumors that trigger cellular senescence. Cellular senescence means that the cells neither divide nor secrete inflammatory messenger substances, but still do not die. The problem here is that these cells can release molecules into neighboring tissues that contribute to further tumor development. The results of the study show that cellular senescence in combination with the specific patterns that were extracted in the course of the analysis are associated with high risk for head and neck cancer patients. In conclusion, the computationally identified markers from genetic and image-based data are a more effective means of capturing the heterogeneity of the tumors. This makes it possible to develop and apply more targeted treatment options swiftly and to monitor high-risk patients more closely. The term head and neck tumors covers various types of cancer that occur in these parts of the body, including carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and nose and sinuses. Most of the malignant tumors are squamous-cell carcinomas, i.e. tumors that originate from surface cells. Other, less common, tumors are adenocarcinomas, which originate from glandular tissue, and sarcomas from soft tissue. According to estimates from the international database Global Cancer Studies, more than 830,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with head and neck cancer every year. According to Statistics Austria, 1,184 men and 404 women were diagnosed with ENT cancer in Austria in 2019. Smoking and alcohol consumption, but also human papilloma viruses are risk factors for head and neck cancer. Medical University of Vienna Spielvogel, C.P., et al. (2022) Radiogenomic markers enable risk stratification and inference of mutational pathway states in head and neck cancer.

Because of the pitch, I got bounce and that is why I enjoyed bowling against these three batsmen. Nets pitches and practice pitches are different because of the bounce the batters were having difficulties. All three of them are World Class players and bowling to them was fun,\" Muhammad Irfan told ANI. \"I am here in Sydney since 2019. I play for the Western suburbs district. Through New South Wales I got an opportunity and I have come to give every team practice before that is why I come to every session for practice,\" he said. 'Chasemaster' Virat Kohli slammed an unbeaten 83 as India pulled off a miracle four-wicket victory over Pakistan in a final over thriller at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup in Melbourne last Sunday. \"Recently Virat helped India win a match against Pakistan. So, it felt great to bowl to him in nets. He is the best batsman in the world. Virat Kohli gave me best wishes and to hear it from one of the best in the world is great,\" he added. During the session, Rahul and Dinesh Karthik faced Ravichandran Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal in the nets. Karthik also practised throw-downs with Kohli. Everything happened under the watchful eyes of Head coach Rahul Dravid and batting coach Vikram Rathour. Rahul and Rohit played some crisp drives and looked in good touch which will reduce management's concerns over the openers' form slump. Rohit who failed to play a critical knock against Pakistan on Sunday had an intense extended practice in the nets. Rishabh Pant was also seen playing some measured shots in the nets.

China is one of India’s large trading partners, with trade flows between the two countries having grown 59% from about $72 billion in 2014-15, to hit $115.4 billion in 2021-22. “Since India-China trade started picking up, the growth in exports to China has been much higher than the import growth,” a Commerce Ministry official told The Hindu . From $11.9 billion in 2014-15, India’s exports to China had risen 78.1% to $21.25 billion last year, while imports stood at $94.16 billion, 55.8% over the $60.4 billion recorded in 2014-15. By contrast, imports from China had increased 192% between 2006-07 and 2013-14, when they had crossed$51 billion, he pointed out. Intermediate goods account for more than a third of India’s imports from China, while capital goods constitute another 19.3%, with telecom and power sector equipment being the key drivers, which helped meet domestic demand in these fast-expanding sectors, the official said. The major items of import from China are electronic components, computer hardware and peripherals, telecom instruments, organic chemicals, industrial machinery for dairy, residual chemicals and allied products, electronic instruments, bulk drugs and intermediates. “India’s dependence on such Chinese goods can be attributed largely to the gap between the domestic production and demand, and China being a manufacturing hub and having price competitiveness due to economies of scale and subsidies provided by its government to Chinese industry,” the official noted. The production-linked incentive schemes for different sectors will help reduce the dependence on such imports over time, even as technical regulations framed for products such as toys, electronics, chemicals and fertilizers will check sub-standard imports, he emphasised.

In fact, services like Nvidia GeForce NOW and Amazon Luna are alive and well. Well, much of that outcome remains to be seen as each company is currently seizing an opportunity to snag Stadia’s audience of nomad gamers who are currently looking for the best alternative. Just this week, GeForce added direct touchscreen gameplay controls – a feature Google brought to the table and innovated on first. Also, Amazon is working overtime to make Luna an attractive replacement for the failed cloud gaming platform. Can “The other guys” carry cloud gaming? So, the question on everyone’s mind, and one that I intend to answer today is “will these other services fail as Stadia has?” Aside from Netflix and its cloud gaming business that it’s trying to spin up over the next few years which will undoubtedly fail for several reasons , I think the answer is “no, not exactly”. I wouldn’t even say that Stadia “failed”. However, it’s not that simple, and while each of these offerings may come and go, they will each help shape the identity and the future of cloud gaming as a whole. Playing games on someone else’s computer from a distance and paying them for it is nothing new. In fact, it all started back with OnLive and although it was before its time, it went on directly to influence Gaikai, which then was bought by Sony and transformed into PlayStation Now, and then PlayStation Plus Premium. It’s not the best service, but it’s one of the juggernauts that’s taken over the space and has the public eye. If it weren’t for OnLive, none of the cloud gaming providers we have today would believe in the possibilities. Stadia had its chance and screwed it up The same could be said for Stadia. Its technology may go on to do better things , and I say that’s a win, despite how I feel about what Google did to the community, its employees, and its partners. It’s certainly left its mark on the industry for better and for worse. More people now believe in cloud gaming than ever before, and while it’s drawn a fair additional amount of criticism for its execution (and its “execution”), the good that it’s done can’t be understated. With more money and more innovative minds working around the clock to create unique experiences and infrastructure, things have moved along a lot faster than they would have otherwise. Others will crop up in its place Actually, that’s precisely my point. Anyone with a pocket full of cash and a strategy – either short-term or long-term – has a golden opportunity right now to be a pioneer in this space. They have a responsibility, and as Uncle Ben says in Spiderman, “With great power, comes great responsibility”. In Google’s case, “irresponsibility”. Amazon has long since been in the gaming space, and I don’t believe it do Luna dirty like Google did Stadia. Even when Google mutilated YouTube Gaming, Twitch was on the rise and getting lots of dedicated attention (no, we’re not talking about Twitch’s latest controversy today). The same can be said for Nvidia – GeForce NOW has been doing fantastic, gaining new features with little to no mob standing outside its headquarters with pitchforks and torches. The company has made graphics cards for gamers for decades, what did you expect? Hosting a cloud gaming service just makes sense for them! Google understands technology, not people Google seems to be the only oddball out here. A search company that’s transitioned to Ai, and has its fingers in literally every other pie (“ my germs! “) while simultaneously feigning dedication to the gaming space and community without truly committing to it couldn’t possibly have hoped to keep traction and build an empire. That’s Google’s main issue – it wants to be everything to everyone, but it doesn’t take the time to understand the community engrained in each space, and that’s why it always fails. Amazon Luna and Nvidia GeForce NOW may very well make the same mistakes and lose their footing in time. Actually, as they add the same features and make many of the same moves, I worry that they may also shut down one day, but as with Stadia, that’s not really the point. All technology is greater than the sum of its parts, and as consumers, we must realize this and adapt. A double-edged sword Cloud gaming has only taken off because of the big guys and their wallets, but that’s also the very reason it’s struggling. It’s a double-edged sword and one we must swallow from both ends without getting cut. I believe we’ll figure it out eventually, but we’re in the “awkward haircut stage” of things, and will grow out of it toward maturity with time. Others will come along in place of those that give up on cloud gaming, and as gamers, we must not avoid the technology just because it’s going through a rough time right now. I see a lot of YouTubers – especially those who are retro and physical game collectors rejoicing that Stadia died, and I don’t believe that’s the right response. Whatever comes next, we should all support it while engaging in important conversations about how it will unfold and serve the audience. History in the making Just because cloud gaming exists, that doesn’t mean you can’t support physical media, though I do understand the argument of companies leaning into it and away from discs if the cloud succeeds. Honestly though, I see innovation as an unstoppable force, regardless of what the old heads like myself and others want to happen. It’s my belief that we have the power to make cloud gaming what it will eventually become, and we have a responsibility as the end users to make it the best it could be by participating in history and giving feedback. I encourage you all to try out both Nvidia GeForce NOW, Amazon Luna, and hell, even Netflix gaming as it starts to take off. Enjoy games for the sake of games wherever they are because that’s what this is all about! In the meantime, become an active voice for what you want and what you don’t want as it takes shape – we’re witnessing history in the making in the same way that we did as kids when the original Nintendo launched in North America.

The Detroit automaker on Tuesday reported earnings of $3.3 billion from July through September, compared with $2.42 billion a year earlier. The increase was fueled largely by a 24% sales increase in the U.S., GM's most profitable market. The company said it is seeing improved supplies of computer chips and other parts, allowing it to build more vehicles and increase inventory on dealer lots. It's also selling more expensive pickup trucks and large SUVs. That boosted revenue for the quarter by 56% to a record $41.89 billion, though that's still short of the $42.1 billion that Wall Street had expected, according to a survey by FactSet. More than 80% of GM's revenue came from North America. Excluding one-time items, GM made $2.25 per share, beating estimates of $1.88. GM reiterated its full-year net income guidance between $9.6 billion and $11.2 billion. GM still expects pretax income of $13 billion to $15 billion. Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said the company isn't seeing any sign that demand for new vehicles is slowing despite higher interest rates and inflation. \"Pricing remains strong, demand remains strong for our products,\" he told reporters early Tuesday. Shares rose 2% after the opening bell. GM finished and shipped about 75% of the 90,000 vehicles it built without one part or another in the second quarter . Dealer inventory as of Sept. 30 rose to 359 million, up from 248 million in the second quarter. \"Overall chips are getting better than certainly where they were a year ago,\" Jacobson said. The company has not seen any signs of a recession, but it's continuing to watch the economy, Jacobson said. It has no plans to cut any workers, but is being selective in hiring, he said. Yet rising interest rates and high gasoline prices, coupled with persistent inflation, could hurt GM from now into 2023. Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau wrote in a note to investors that although sales have improved, they have yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. It's hard to predict how interest rates and inflation will affect consumer spending in the coming year, he said in an interview. Historically, rising interest rates present difficulty for automakers. \"Consumers have higher costs , and they tend to maybe pull back on purchases, look for cheaper alternatives,\" Windau said. Auto prices, he said, may have to drop \"as consumers become more focused on their financial situation and what they're willing to bite off from a payment perspective.\" The entire auto industry has been hit hard by shortages of computer chips and other parts since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The industry shuttered plants early in the pandemic, but they came back faster than expected, and by then, the semiconductor industry had switched to making chips for computers, games and other consumer electronics . The auto industry has been trying to get more chips ever since. Windau wrote that the virus is still affecting the supply chain and could cause further issues. GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts that although parts supplies are improving, the company faces challenges to get chips and other parts. \"It's still very tight,\" she said. \"Even a small hiccup usually has an impact.\" GM's joint venture in China is recovering from pandemic lockdowns, with about $330 million in equity income versus $270 million last quarter. The company's Cruise autonomous vehicle unit lost nearly $500 million as it expands a self-driving ride-hailing service from San Francisco into Austin, Texas, and Phoenix. There also was an accounting change for employee stock compensation. The company said it expects Cruise to generate $1 billion in revenue in 2025. Barra said buyers of GM's electric vehicles should be eligible for half of a $7,500 federal tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act as early as January. The law requires that batteries and vehicles be made in North America, which GM already meets. But 40% of the battery metals have to be mined or recycled on the continent, and those rules become more strict over time. \"We'll ramp up to have full qualification in the next two to three years, getting to the full $7,500,\" Barra said.

The regulator told Google to pay 9.36 billion rupees ($113.5 million) and to allow Play Store developers to use third-party payment systems for app and in-app purchases.After a lengthy investigation, the Competition Commission of India said Google's requirement for Play Store developers to use its billing system “constitutes an imposition of unfair condition,” as TechCrunch reports. The regulator found that Google didn't use the billing system for its own apps, which it said constituted an “imposition of discriminatory conditions.”The agency has ordered Google to open up the Play Store to third-party payments within three months. It said Google can't impose any anti-steering provisions on app developers and mustn't hinder them from promoting apps and services to users. Likewise, the company can't restrict users from accessing developers' services and features.The Competition Commission also stated that Google must be fully transparent with Play Store developers and that it can't impose any condition on them \"which is unfair, unreasonable, discriminatory or disproportionate to the services provided to the app developers.\" Furthermore, Google will need to have a clear and transparent data collection policy, and it will not be allowed to use \"competitively relevant transaction/consumer data of apps generated and acquired\" through the Google Play Billing System to its competitive advantage.The regulator has determined that Google has a dominant position in the spheres of licensable smartphone operating systems, app stores, web searching, video hosting platforms and \"non-OS specific\" mobile web browsers. Last week, the Competition Commission fined the company $161.9 million after finding that Google abused Android's dominance. It said smartphone makers shouldn't have to preinstall Google's apps and that the company shouldn't withhold Play Services APIs and monetary and other incentives from other parties.Google reportedly has a 97 percent smartphone market share in India, while Google Play is one of the most popular payments services. India is the company's largest market in terms of user numbers.

Known as forever chemicals because they last thousands of years, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS, are a group of synthetic organic contaminants used in a variety of industrial processes and consumer products , including non-stick cookware coatings, food wrappers, water-resistant clothing, and furniture textiles. When these products are used, discarded, or improperly dumped, PFAS leach into water systems . Once there, they are incredibly difficult to treat because of unique chemical properties imparted by carbon-fluorine bonds—some of the strongest in chemistry. The precise amount of PFAS in the country's drinking water is unknown, but experts say that it ranges from widespread to almost ubiquitous. Long-term, low-concentration exposure to PFAS can hamper the immune system , interfere with hormones, and reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. It can also cause low birth weight and high cholesterol. Those who are exposed to high doses of PFAS at work or because they live near a dumping site are at increased risk for kidney cancer, liver damage, testicular cancer, and thyroid disease. The team compared two of the most promising types of separation media—granular-activated carbon and anion exchange resins—to remove PFAS. They systematically evaluated how well each of these worked for different types of PFAS in pilot municipal water treatment plants for 15 months, concluding that the resins were more effective in removing most of the tested PFAS. \"You can think of the treatments as being large-scale versions of the filters people use at home to purify their own drinking water. Water is continuously fed from the top, and we measure the amount of time before we start to detect PFAS coming out of the end of the filter,\" says Steven Chow, research associate in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins and first author of the study. The results appeared in Water Research . The researchers say that the study is promising because it provides one of the most in-depth laboratory analyses of a large-scaled engineered PFAS treatment system to date. Normally, laboratory research has limitations in practical applicability because it's conducted on a small-scale over limited time. And many large-scale engineered systems run by drinking water utilities do not have the luxury of in-depth analysis of their systems beyond regulatory requirements, the engineers say. \"Our collaboration between academia, industry, and municipal partners allowed the team to answer fundamental questions on how these separation media work while demonstrating their effectiveness under real-world conditions,\" Chow says. While the technical outlook for filtering PFAS from drinking water is promising, the researchers warn that there are caveats. Building and operating such systems can cost millions of dollars, which is in addition to the cost of existing water treatment operations. Once the PFAS are removed, the contaminants and the filter used to collect them must be properly handled and disposed of, and because PFAS molecules are so strong, an incredible amount of energy is required to destroy them. Chow maintains that when it comes to PFAS, prevention may be the best cure. \"PFAS are a generational environmental problem that will take decades to manage and may never be completely solved,\" he says. \"The key is forward-thinking policies to that reduce the total amount of PFAS released in the environment and prevent a regrettable substitution of known PFAS with chemicals of unknown or potentially worse outcomes.\" The research team also included Kellogg J. Schwab, professor, and Carsten Prasse, assistant professor, both of the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering. The study was conducted in collaboration with the Canada-based environmental engineering company Stantec.

Verstappen then had to hold off the pestering Hamilton through the final laps as his team warned him not to exceed track limits that would draw a penalty. The win was a relief for Red Bull. The team had announced shortly before qualifying on Saturday that Mateschitz had died at age 78. Verstappen vowed he'd give everything to get the win to honour him. \"We gave it everything out there, it was a difficult weekend for us,\" Verstappen said. \"The only thing we could do today was win.\" \"This one is definitely dedicated to Dietrich,\" Verstappen said. \"I pushed it to the limit to come back.\" The win continued Verstappen's run of dominance in 2022.

Apart from him, Hasan Mahmud chipped in well with two wickets while captain Shakib Al Hasan and Soumya Sarkar picked a wicket each too. Netherlands were also hurt by two run-outs early in their chase, which almost derailed their chase. Colin Ackermann stood up to be the lone fighter for the Netherlands with a valiant 48-ball 62 and Van Meekeren gave Bangladesh a scare with a late cameo of 24 off 14 balls, but it wasn't enough for the Netherlands to chase down the total, skittled out for 135 in 20 overs. In defence of 144, Ahmed dismissed Vikramjit Singh on the first delivery of the innings, as the youngster was caught brilliantly at first slip. He then followed it up with a short outswinger and forced Bas de Leede to poke at it, giving the keeper a regulation catch behind to give Bangladesh a rollicking start. In the fourth over, opener Max O'Dowd and Tom Cooper were run-out after suffering bad mix-ups, resulting in two run-outs for the Netherlands in a span of three balls. Amidst the ruins, Ackermann struck boundaries off the pacer to add 44 runs for the fifth wicket with captain Scott Edwards. But once Edwards fell after reverse-sweeping to point off Shakib in the 13th over, it led to another slide for the Netherlands despite Ackermann hitting boundaries and reaching his fifty with literally no support from the other end. Ackermann's excellent knock came to an end in the 17th over when he holed out to deep mid-wicket to be Ahmed's fourth victim of the match. Van Meekeren played the long handle to perfection to hit three fours and a six, but he slog-swept straight to deep mid-wicket on the final ball of the innings off Sarkar to give Bangladesh a winning start to their campaign. Brief scores: Bangladesh 144/8 in 20 overs (Afif Hossain 38, Najmul Hossain Shanto 25; Paul van Meekeren 2/21, Bas de Leede 2/29) beat Netherlands 135 all out in 20 overs (Colin Ackermann 62, Paul van Meekeren 24; Taskin Ahmed 4/25, Hasan Mahmud 2/15) by nine runs.

Robert Lewandowski added a third in the 22nd minute and Bilbao weren't helped by Ander Herrera limping off injured. Herrera's replacement Dani Garcia also had to go off injured in what was a relatively tepid second half which saw Ferran Torres score Barca's fourth following a pass from Dembele. Atletico Madrid moved third after a 2-1 win away to Real Betis thanks to two goals from Antoine Griezmann. The Frenchman's first goal was a near-post corner that nobody was able to cut out, and his second was a finish from a narrow angle that went through the legs of Betis keeper Rui Silva. Nabil Fekir pulled a goal back for Betis with six minutes left, but the home side were unable to find an equalizer, leaving Betis coach Manuel Pellegrini to complain Atletico had taken the lead \"without even having a shot on target.\" Ten-man Villarreal won at home to Almeria in a dramatic game. Almeria opened the scoring in the 31st minute thanks to Gonzalo Melero. Alex Baena scored Villarreal's equaliser in the 56th minute, but was then harshly sent off for a second yellow card after lifting his shirt to show a message of support for the club's former vice president, who died last week. Villarreal held on with 10 men and got their reward in the 94th minute when Nicholas Jackson scored the winner from a Dani Parejo cross. Elche remain bottom of the table, but took a valuable 2-2 draw away to Espanyol, who continue to struggle for a win. Pere Milla put Elche ahead early in the game, but although Javi Puado and Martin Braithwaite turned it around for Espanyol, Gonzalo Verdu snatched an equalizer with seven minutes left to play. Girona climbed out of the bottom three with a 1-1 draw at home to Osasuna, with defender David Lopez scoring a 46th minute goal to cancel out Kike Barja's opener for the visitors, six minutes earlier. On Saturday, Real Madrid had a convincing 3-1 win at home to Sevilla, with Luka Modric putting them ahead in the fourth minute. Madrid dominated the first half, but were stunned by Erik Lamela's 53rd-minute goal for Sevilla, before Vinicius set up substitute Lucas Vazquez for Madrid's second in the 78th minute and Fede Valverde continued his excellent recent form with another powerful shot to make it 3-1. Lee Kang-in scored an 83rd-minute winner against his former club as Mallorca came back from a goal down to stun Valencia 2-1 at the Mestalla Stadium.

The Public Notice stated that “The UGC is committed to the goal of developing a safe, secure and violence free environment in all the educational institutions across the country. It has been reviewing the safety of the campus communities especially women from time to time and issuing guidelines for the same. In this regard, the UGC again set up a committee in 2022 and tasked it with reviewing and updating the safety guidelines for implementation.” The guidelines are broadly classified into two interlinked domains infrastructural facilities and amenities for a safe and secure environment and women cells for sensitisation, policy implementation, monitoring and grievance redressal. The list of some of the guidelines issued by the UGC for the women students that are also under the NEP (National Education Policy 2020) are: 1. Students should be provided with a handbook at the time of admission that would contain detailed information about rules and regulations regarding proper conduct and behaviour expected of them 2. Professional counselling services should be available on campus to address the psychological and emotional concerns of the students 3. Safety of women is a paramount concern for all. The higher education choices are, quite often, limited by perceptions of risk involved in going “outside” the home for higher education 4. The HEIs should ensure easy access to basic sanitation and hygiene facilities for women such as clean, well maintained and fully functioning separate restrooms equipped with 24 hours tap water supply, soap, covered dustbins, sanitary pad disposal bins and vending machines in all its buildings 5. The campus and the adjoining areas should be well-lit. Sports and other playgrounds and public parks should have flood lights 6. The HEIs should provide reliable and consistent transport facilities and feeder buses for all students, especially for women students and female staff, for safe transit within the campus Recent safety concerns of women in HEIs The students of NIT Trichy staged a protest recently since only students from the girls' hostel had curfews in place which denied them access to common campus facilities such as labs and libraries at night. A few weeks ago, a canteen worker from IIT Bombay climbed up the wall to the girl's hostel and peeked into the hostel bathroom. In another instance, at Chandigarh University, a girl from the hostel allegedly leaked videos of other students in the hostel bathroom which led to protests in the University. edexlive\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/ugc-frames-new-guidelines-on-safety-of-women-in-educational-institutions/","tags":[],"title":"UGC frames new guidelines on safety of women in educational institutions"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Dhoni Entertainment forays into Tamil film production Dhoni Entertainment will be producing its first film in Tamil, a family entertainer conceptualised by Sakshi Singh Dhoni\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/dhoni-entertainment-forays-into-tamil-film-production/","tags":[],"title":"Dhoni Entertainment forays into Tamil film production"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Kishore on Kantara row: ‘Think for a moment before falling prey…’ indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/kishore-on-kantara-row-think-for-a-moment-before-falling-prey/","tags":["Entertainment","Regional"],"title":"Kishore on Kantara row: ‘Think for a moment before falling prey…’"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Realme 10 Series Specifications Surface Again, Tipped to Launch in November The TENAA listings of the Realme 10 5G and Realme 10 Pro+ 5G have been updated to reveal the specifications of the two smartphones.

The advance bookings for the film have recorded less than decent numbers across the country. But will, Ram Setu which sees Akshay play the role of an archaeologist, manage to entice the audience this festive season of Diwali is the question. As per reports, Ram Setu has started off on a rather decent note with occupancy being pegged at 25% over morning shows. In fact, the film also witnessed a good spate of spot bookings, with some mass centres even featuring houseful boards as well. Speaking about the release on a pan-India scale, three national multiplex chains feature Ram Setu selling around 39,000 tickets over its advance booking period. However, the total ticket sales did not manage to cross 1 lakh limit. With this, the overall advance bookings for Ram Setu estimate an opening day collection of Rs. 1.50 cr. nett. However, given the festive season of Diwali and the holiday period that has put the audience in high spirits predictions state the film will see a good spate of spot bookings on its opening day. In fact, going by past examples, walk in audience on Diwali have always accounted for a major chunk of a film’s collections, and in the case of Ram Setu, this is likely to be true. As per these predictions, Ram Setu could see its Day 1 collections hovering between Rs. 12-13 cr. on Day 1.\nbollywoodhungama\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/ram-setu-box-office-occupancy-report-day-1-akshay-kumar-starrer-opens-to-2/","tags":[],"title":"Ram Setu Box Office occupancy report Day 1: Akshay Kumar starrer opens to 25% occupancy"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Punjab: World\u0026rsquo;s largest diya lit in Mohali to promote message of global peace and unity Around 10,000 citizens, including 4,000 residents of Hero Homes pooled in approximately 3,560 liters of organic and diya-appropriate oils.\nHero Homes in Punjab's Mohali witnessed a world record activity - lighting of the world's largest diya installed at the premises.

Here\u0026rsquo;s a look at the first Indian-origin PM\u0026rsquo;s journey The 42-year-old has his roots in India and is the husband of Akshata Murty, daughter of Infosys Founder NR Narayan Murty\nRishi Sunak! The new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK). While India was involved in bursting crackers and lighting up the sky during Diwali, Rishi Sunak also contributed to this celebration by becoming the UK PM on Monday, October 24, 2022. The celebrations for Diwali 2022 started off fantastically with India clinching a fabulous win against Pakistan in ICC World Cup T20 2022 on Sunday, October 23 and the UK getting its first Indian-origin PM the next day resulted in more celebrations. The 42-year-old has scripted history by becoming the first Indian-origin UK PM and not to forget, the first PM of colour too. Having said that, who is Sunak? And is he really from India? #WhatTheFAQ is here to give details on these and a lot more. How did this happen? It all started in July 2022, when Sunak participated in the Conservative Party leadership race to replace Boris Johnson. The fight was between Sunak and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on July 20. Truss ended up becoming the new PM defeating Sunak. Now, following the resignation of Truss on October 20 in the wake of high tax cuts, mini-budget and so on, the political fight was between Sunak, Boris Johnson and Penelope Mary Mordaunt, Leader of the House of Commons. With Johnson dropping out of the race and Sunak getting the support from Members of Parliament on October 22, he was declared as the new Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on October 23. The highlight of his oath-taking was that he was the first Hindu-origin PM. Additionally, the MP from Yorkshire Sunak took oath on the Bhagavad Gita in Parliament and he was the first UK parliamentarian to take an oath on the Gita. So, Punjab da putar becomes UK PM? The 42-year-old was born on May 12, 1980, in Southampton, Hampshire to African-born Hindu parents of Indian descent, namely, Yashvir Sunka and Usha Sunak. While Yashvir was a National Health Service General Practitioner, Usha Sunak ran a chemist shop. Having said that, how is the eldest son of the Sunak family of Indian origin? His roots can be traced to the Punjab province of British India as his grandparents lived there and migrated to the UK in the 1960s. Paternal grandparents: Ramdas Sunak from Gujranwala (in present-day Pakistan) moved to Nairobi in 1935 to work as a clerk. In 1937, he married Suhag Rani Sunak from Delhi Maternal grandparents: Raghubir Sain Berry MBE, worked in Tanganyika as a tax official and was married to Tanganyika-born Sraksha. In 1996, they along with their three children, moved to the UK and Raghubir joined the Inland Revenue, and as a collector, was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1988. Also, in 2009, Rishi married Akshata Murty, daughter of India's richest businessman and the Founder of the technology company Infosys NR Narayana Murthy who is married to Sudha Murthy, a well-known author, philanthropist and an Indian educator. Rishi Sunak and Akshata are blessed with two daughters: Krishna and Anoushka. What is his educational and political history? Sunak attended Stroud School and Winchester College where he was a head boy. During the summer holidays, he worked as a waiter at a curry house in Southampton. Later, he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Lincoln College, Oxford. During his university time, he pursued an internship at Conservative Campaign Headquarters. Followed by securing an MBA from Stanford University in 2006 as a Fulbright Scholar. It was while pursuing his MBA that he met his wife, Akshata Murthy. Political career 2015: Elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond in North Yorkshire 2015-17: Member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee 2016: At the June 2016 EU membership referendum, Sunak supported Brexit, that is, the UK leaving the European Union (EU), a supranational political and economic union of 27 member states 2017: Re-elected again and served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of state for local government between January 2018 and July 2019 2019: Appointed as Chief Secretary to the Treasury by then Prime Minister Boris Johnson on July 24 2020: On February 13, promoted to Chancellor as part of a cabinet reshuffle 2022: Amid the government crisis, following Jhonson's resignation, on July 5 Sunak resigned as chancellor What are the world leaders saying? These are a few of the many leaders who took to Twitter to express their best wishes: PM of India Narendra Modi: \"As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues, and implementing Roadmap 2030.\" European Council President Charles Michel: \"Working together is the only way to face common challenges... and bringing stability is key to overcoming them.\" Irish PM Micheál Martin said he is looking forward to working with Mr Sunak, \"on the important issues we face on these islands and globally\". US President Biden described Mr Sunak's nomination as the UK's next prime minister as a \"ground-breaking milestone\" What's in store for the Indian-origin PM? Sunak now faces the enormous challenge of steering the UK economy through massive inflationary turbulence and also uniting the different wings of a divided Conservative Party. Moreover, during his campaigning for the PM post, he faced criticism for his lavish house, expensive suits and shoes. Also, he has a net worth of over 700 million pounds and is vested in properties in the UK. Apart from owning a mansion in Yorkshire, he owns a property in Kensington in Central London.\nedexlive\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/whatthefaq-rishi-sunak-is-uks-new-pm-heres-a-look-at-the-first-indian-/","tags":[],"title":"#WhatTheFAQ: Rishi Sunak is UK's new PM.

The six-time Team Europe player claimed a one-shot victory over American Kurt Kitayama thanks to a four under par final round 67 at Congaree Golf Club. Although currently qualifying in the third automatic spot on the European Points List, McIlroy does bolster his standing on the World Points List as he leapfrogged Shane Lowry in pole position on 80.62 points. \"I'm really proud of myself,\" McIlroy said after his 23rd PGA TOUR win. \"It means a lot.

We already know the phones will pack some top-of-the-line specifications on the three models in the series. Redmi has now dropped a new piece of information, saying the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G — the highest-end phone in the series — will feature a 200-megapixel camera in the rear system. The upcoming Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G will come with a 200-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL HPX sensor, the company confirmed in a post on Weibo. This is a 1/1.4-inch sensor with a 2.24μm pixel size. Samsung announced the HPX sensor recently, which makes the upcoming Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G probably the first phone with that sensor. According to Redmi, the Samsung ISOCELL HPX sensor is about 24 percent bigger than the Sony IMX766, which should mean it will let more light in. The Redmi Note 12 Pro is expected to get the Sony IMX766 sensor. What to expect Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G’s rear camera system looks very similar to the previous generation phone, but the company has not confirmed anything else. We know it is launching in China, but a new leak also suggests that the phone’s India launch may not be far away. According to tipster Mukul Sharma, Redmi has got the Redmi Note 12 series certified on the website of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The phone with model number 22101316I, where “I” stands for India, has appeared on the platform. Meanwhile, the phone’s global variant with model number 22101316G has cropped up on the IMEI database, which means the company is also planning a global launch of the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G. While the two listings confirm the launch of these phones in markets outside of China, they do not reveal if the Indian and global variants will be any different from the Chinese model of the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G. We will hopefully find out more about the Redmi Note 12 series in the coming days.

The billionaire insisted the United Kingdom’s current economic woes are the result of a poorly negotiated Brexit deal and not the Liz Truss government’s controversial tax cut proposals. Billionaire Says Poor Brexit Deal Is Source of UK’s Economic Woes The British billionaire investor Guy Hands has warned that Britain needs to renegotiate Brexit if it is to avoid seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a report has said. According to Hands, Britain’s poorly negotiated exit from the European Union is the primary cause of the United Kingdom’s ongoing economic woes. As per a report by The Telegraph, Hands believes Britain’s period of economic pain — which seemingly reached its crescendo when the pound fell to its lowest exchange rate versus the dollar — started six years ago and could eventually see the country become “the sick man of Europe.” While Britain might not need the bailout right away, Hands, founder of private equity firm Terra Firma, insists seeking such financial assistance will become a reality if U.K. ministers fail to renegotiate the Brexit deal. Hands warned about the current course of the country: Steadily increasing taxes, steadily reducing benefits and social services, higher interest rates and eventually the need for a bailout from the IMF. Hands, who is a supporter of the ruling Conservative Party, reportedly suggested that he does not think the outgoing Liz Truss government’s tax cut proposals are to blame for the United Kingdom’s financial mess. Hands: Conservatives Must Own Up to Their Mistake Tax cut proposals by Kwasi Kwarteng — the United Kingdom’s former chancellor of the exchequer — reportedly spooked financial markets, causing the pound to fall to its lowest ever level versus the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, the billionaire investor suggested there has to be some reckoning that the Brexit deal is poor and that it only put Britain on a disastrous economic path. In his remarks directed at the Conservative Party, which has since chosen Rishi Sunak to become the UK’s next prime minister, the billionaire said: “I think if the Tory party can own up to the mistake in how they negotiated Brexit and have somebody leading it that actually has the intellectual capability and the authority to negotiate Brexit, there is a possibility of turning around the economy, but without that the economy is frankly doomed.” After touching a low of 1.03 per one dollar, the pound has since recovered and is trading at £1:$1.13 at the time of writing.

The digital asset achieved a milestone on November 10, 2021 when it attained its all-time high (ATH) value of $69,044 which pushed its total market capitalization to over $1.2 trillion. The crypto, however, has suffered great losses since then, losing 72% of its ATH as it continues to struggle to initiate a bullish run. At press time, according to tracking from Coingecko, BTC is trading at $19,341 and is down by over 68% on a year-to-date basis. Its market cap was also affected by the severe price dump, plummeting all the way down to $371 billion. But despite all of these, Bitcoin was still able to keep its status as the largest cryptocurrency in terms of overall valuation. It also continues to show its dominance, outperforming almost all major assets for the third quarter of 2022. Crypto Juggernaut Steady Despite Bearish Market Coingecko, a digital currency price and information data platform, recently released an update as to how Bitcoin and some major assets as well as fiat currencies performed three months after the first half of 2022. The analysis involved the market capitalization of BTC, US Dollar Index (DXY), Crude Oil, Gold, Japanese Yen and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT). Among all the assets involved, only DXY managed to tally gains, increasing its market cap by 7% during the 3rd quarter of the year. Image: CoinCentral Bitcoin, ranking 2nd behind the US Dollar Index, had its overall valuation dip by 1% over the last three months. Despite the drop, the cryptocurrency managed to buck its current bearish market to perform better than crude oil and gold as well as TLT and the Japanese Yen. Still, the leading crypto fails in comparison to the overall market cap of gold which currently stands at $10.928 trillion. Bitcoin: Still A Long Climb To Reclaim Lost Glory While holders and investors appreciate these kinds of victories that Bitcoin earn and put under its belt, it’s undeniable that the asset dubbed as “digital gold” still has lots of work to do if it hopes to cement its status as the future of money. According to the 5-day forecast of Coincodex, BTC is expected to slightly increase its trading price to $19,440. But the 30-day prediction for the digital asset is bleak as it points at another significant price dump to trade at $15,117. Should this trend continue, Bitcoin’s 4th quarter performance could be worse than the showing it had during the months of July, August and September. Traders, investors and holders are all still looking forward with hopes that the cryptocurrency will emulate its previous bullish runs and deliver sizable gains and profits for them.

The recall also covers brands such as Nexxus, Suave, Tresemmé and Tigi, which makes Rockaholic and Bed Head dry shampoos, according to a notice posted on the Food and Drug Administration’s website Friday. Unilever’s recall pertains to products made prior to October 2021. The move once again raises questions about the safety of aerosols in personal-care products. In the past year and a half, a number of aerosol sunscreens have been pulled from shelves, such as Johnson \u0026 Johnson’s Neutrogena, Edgewell Personal Care Co.’s Banana Boat and Beiersdorf AG’s Coppertone along with spray-on antiperspirants like Procter \u0026 Gamble Co.’s Secret and Old Spice and Unilever’s Suave. The recalls were set off by findings of benzene in such products by an analytical lab called Valisure, based in New Haven, Connecticut, starting in May 2021. This isn’t the first time spray-on dry shampoo has been identified as a problem. P\u0026G tested its whole portfolio of aerosol products following Valisure’s findings. The company then recalled its Pantene and Herbal Essences dry shampoos in December, citing benzene contamination. “Given what we’ve seen, it unfortunately makes sense that other consumer-product categories, like aerosol dry shampoos, could be heavily affected by benzene contamination and we are actively investigating this area,” said Valisure Chief Executive Officer David Light. The problem with aerosols has largely appeared to be from the propellants used to spray the personal-care products from the cans. Unilever said this was the case with its dry shampoo recall. The company did not release the amount of benzene found in the products, though said it was recalling them out of an abundance of caution. The FDA said “daily exposure to benzene in the recalled products at the levels detected in testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences.” Yet the agency also said exposure to benzene can result in leukemia and other blood cancers. Spray-on personal-care products like dry shampoos often contain propellants like propane and butane, which are petroleum distillates made by refining crude oil. Benzene is a known contaminant of petroleum products. The FDA has confirmed propellants are a potential source of benzene contamination. While the FDA hasn’t set benzene limits for cosmetics like dry shampoo, it does say the products shouldn’t contain “any poisonous or deleterious substance.”\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/dove-other-unilever-aerosol-dry-shampoos-recalled-over-cancer-risk/","tags":[],"title":"Dove, other Unilever aerosol dry shampoos recalled over cancer risk"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Henry Cavill confirms DC future as Superman after cameo in Black Adam indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/henry-cavill-confirms-dc-future-as-superman-after-cameo-in-black-adam/","tags":["Entertainment","Hollywood"],"title":"Henry Cavill confirms DC future as Superman after cameo in Black Adam"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"OnePlus Nord N300 5G with MediaTek processor, 5000mAh battery launched OnePlus Nord N300 5G smartphone is now official.

The price cap proposed and pushed by the G7 with the purpose of allowing Russian oil to continue flowing, but at lower than market prices, still has many details to be hashed out, Birol said at the Singapore International Energy Week, as carried by Reuters. Last month, the G7 group of the most industrialized nations agreed to finalize and implement a price cap on Russian oil, aiming to reduce Vladimir Putin’s oil revenues for his war chest. The G7 will ban maritime transportation services for Russian oil unless the products are purchased at or below a certain price cap. European Union ambassadors also endorsed the price cap after reaching an agreement earlier this month to impose a new package of sanctions on Russia, including banning maritime transportation for Russian oil to third-party countries unless the oil is sold below or at a certain price cap. Many analysts and experts doubt that the price cap would serve its dual purpose of cutting revenues for Putin while keeping Russian oil flowing because top importers China and India haven’t signed onto the price cap, and because Putin could simply make good on his promise to halt all energy supply—including crude, fuels, natural gas, and coal—to the countries that sign up to cap the price of Russian oil. Last week, a U.S. Treasury official and industry representatives admitted to Reuters that Russia could largely evade the price cap because it would likely have access to enough own tankers and transport and insurance services to ship its oil. There have been estimates that Russia could continue to ship 80-90% of its oil outside the price cap regime, and those estimates “are not unreasonable,” the unnamed U.S. official told Reuters .

While users are facing inconvenience for the inability to send messages and make WhatsApp calls, Meta has finally come out with a statement explaining the same. Meta, which also owns Facebook, Instagram , and Oculus, has now come out with a statement to reassure that the company is taking action on the issue and will bring it back online soon. In a statement to Reuters, a Meta spokesperson said, “We're aware that some people are currently having trouble sending messages and we're working to restore WhatsApp for everyone as quickly as possible.” Sadly, Meta hasn't given any timeline behind this outage and is unable to furnish the reason why the world's most popular messenger service is out today. As of publishing, we are still experiencing an outage of WhatsApp across the mobile app and the desktop client. WhatsApp not working: What to do now Not only WhatsApp app, but even the WhatsApp Web service is out. The WhatsApp Web interface shows the “trying to reconnect” message. Since the messenger service is out and there is no timeline furnished on when we can expect it to work, here are some alternatives to send messages or communicate with your peers/ family/colleagues. The easiest way to text your contacts is to reach out via SMS. SMS service on Jio , Vi and Airtel offer up to 100 free messages per day. However, you won't be able to send multimedia files. This is where you can use other messaging apps . You can use Telegram, Signal, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram messaging for the time being. If you use an iPhone and your contacts also use an iPhone, you can rely on Apple's iMessage to reach out to your dear ones. For those working the Google Workspace, they can also use the built-in messaging service.\nhindustantimes_tech\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/whatsapp-not-working-meta-speaks-out-this-is-the-latest-update/","tags":[],"title":"WhatsApp not working: Meta speaks out, this is the latest update"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"WhatsApp is down and messages won\u0026rsquo;t send - here\u0026rsquo;s what we know WhatsApp appears to be down, with messages not sending.

Well, success is subjective and it's a long way ahead. I pray that my conscience help me serve my people better and hence, I seek blessings and good wishes in my way ahead.\" She mentioned.

Venkatachalam said government banks like Bank of Maharashtra is denying trade union rights while Canara Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and IDBI Bank are outsourcing many banking activities. According to him, at the Central Bank of India, it is 'jungle raj' with the management resorting to indiscriminate transfers.

The Pakistani side, according to the report, made huge efforts to persuade the kingdom to honour the MoUs and invest in the South Asian nation. Islamabad also put its weight behind Riyadh, which has locked horns with Washington over the cut in oil supply in the international market, The News reported. In February 2019, during the visit of Mohammad Bin Salman to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia signed MoUs for an investment of $21 billion in various sectors of the economy, including for the project of a deep conversion refinery and petrochemical complex with an investment of $12 billion. The Saudi oil giant Aramco also conducted a study in this regard which found that setting up a refinery in Gwadar was not feasible. However, it can be established at Hub, Balochistan, or near Karachi, the official said, The News reported. Later, when the ties of Imran Khan's government got strained with Saudi Arabia, the top decision-makers of the kingdom virtually put MoUs of $21 billion on the backburner signed in February 2019, the official said. Now in the latest scenario, the official said, the Ministry of Petroleum is working on an upgrade of the draft for the refining policy to allure investment for setting up new refineries. The government is making up its mind to offer the investors profitability at 14-15 per cent against the offer of 9 per cent, earlier offered in the draft for refining policy prepared by the PTI government, apart from increasing the tax holiday's scope. The government also wants investment from China for a refinery and to this effect, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his upcoming visit to China, will offer Beijing to set up a refinery in Pakistan.

Sunak's change in fate was triggered by the resignation of Truss after her high-profile sacking and resignation in her cabinet, following a heavily criticised mini-budget that left the UK pound tumbling. After she was forced to step down just 45 days into office, Truss became the shortest-serving British PM. Standing before 10 Downing Street, Truss said that she recognizes she \"cannot deliver the mandate\" on which she was elected. Truss' ascent to power was paved by the Tory leadership crisis following Boris Johnson's resignation in July, after a series of resignations of cabinet members, who protested against his scandal-plagued leadership. Within weeks, Sunak and Truss rose to the Conservative ranks to end up as finalists for the contest for the post of UK Prime Minister. Liz Truss was later appointed as the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in September, which lasted less than 45 days. After Truss resigned on Thursday, Rishi Sunak and former Prime Minister Boris Johnson were seen as frontrunners for the UK PM bid. But Boris Johnson ruled himself out of the Conservative party leadership race despite claiming he had the required support. The former UK PM said he had come to the conclusion \"this would simply not be the right thing to do\" as \"you can't govern effectively unless you have a united party in Parliament.\" Sunak is born in Southampton to parents of Indian descent who migrated to Britain from East Africa. An Oxford, and Stanford University alumnae, Sunak is famously married to Akshata Murty, the daughter of NR Narayana Murthy, the billionaire businessman who founded Infosys. Earlier in April, reports of Akshata's non-domicile status and alleged tax evasion had created a furrow. Rishi Sunak claimed that she has been paying all taxes. Her spokesperson said that Akshata Murthy \"has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income\".

Trivedi, on Friday set aside the Gauhati High Court order granting bail to the two accused. The Gauhati High Court granted relief of bail to accused named Khalil Uddin and Md Abdul Hai alias Abdul Hai Talukdar in connection with crime registered pursuant to the Narcotics Control Bureau in respect of offences punishable under Sections 21(c) read with 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act). The High Court had released two accused on bail after they were in custody for about a year. Questioning the grant of relief to the accused, instant appeals have been preferred by NCB. \"What emerges from the record is that large quantity of contraband weighing about 13 kg of morphine was found in a car which was driven by Md. Jakir Hussain. Whether the role played by said Md. Jakir Hussain could get connected with both the accused is a question,\" the court said. The court further noted that going by the circumstances on record, at this stage, on the strength of the statement of Nizam Uddin, though allegedly retracted later, the matter stands on a different footing. \"In our considered view, in the face of the mandate of Section 37 of the Act, the High Court could not and ought not to have released the accused on bail,\" the court said. \"We, therefore, allow these appeals, set aside the view taken by the High Court and direct that both the appellants be taken in custody forthwith,\" the court said. The court also noted that the charge sheet has been filed and hence directed the trial court to take up the matter and conclude the proceedings as early as possible and preferably within six months from the receipt of this order. According to prosecution, contraband material weighing about 13 kg of morphine was found in a motor vehicle which was driven by a co-accused named Md. Jakir Hussain. During the course of the investigation, it was found that the motor vehicle was registered in the name of Md. Nizam Uddin who had executed a sale letter and handed over the custody of the vehicle to accused Md. Abdul Hai and that Md. Jakir Hussain was the driver employed by Md. Abdul Hai and that contraband material in question were to be handed over to the accused – Khalil Uddin, an owner of a tea shop.

Apple TV+ will increase by $2 per month (if you pay monthly) or $10 per year (if you pay yearly). The new prices are $6.99 per month or $69 per year. Apple Music's price hike is $1 for individuals and $2 for families, thus the new prices are $10.99 per month for the individual plan and $16.99 per month for the family plan. Finally, the Apple One bundle, which includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, iCloud+, Apple News+, and Apple Fitness+, is going up by $2 for the individual plan (now $16.95 per month up from $14.95), $3 for the family plan (now $22.95 per month up from $19.95), and also $3 for the Premier plan (now $32.95 up from $29.95). An Apple spokesperson provided TechCrunch with the following statement regarding the price increases: The subscription prices for Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple One will increase beginning today. The change to Apple Music is due to an increase in licensing costs, and in turn, artists and songwriters will earn more for the streaming of their music. We also continue to add innovative features that make Apple Music the world’s best listening experience. We introduced Apple TV+ at a very low price because we started with just a few shows and movies. Three years later, Apple TV+ is home to an extensive selection of award-winning and broadly acclaimed series, feature films, documentaries, and kids and family entertainment from the world’s most creative storytellers. These prices are obviously all for the US market, but there's no reason to believe international markets won't see proportionally similar price hikes too.

As the team continues to draw the ire of fans, Russell Westbrook finds himself in a dire situation. The 33-year-old point guard’s struggles from the field make him the poster boy of social media trolling. Westbrook, who is 3-fo-17 in his jump shots so far, is in no mood to regulate his attempts from the field. Currently shooting 28.9% from the field, the situation has reached a point where the opposition doesn’t consider the Lakers guard worthy enough to be guarded. russell westbrook has the least-defended jumper of all-time 😨 — buckets (@buckets) It’s a sad state of affairs for Lakers Nation, who have no option but to deal with the incompetencies of the organization as a whole. A complete misfit on the roster, the potential plan of having Westbrook come off the bench is yet to see the light of day with constant speculations about it. Also read: Amid all the criticism surrounding Brodie, Lakers veteran Magic Johnson would share his words of wisdom for the former OKC superstar during an appearance on Shannon Sharpe’s Club Shay Shay Podcast. Widely regarded as one of the greatest point guards of all time, Magic played his entire career for the purple and gold, bringing the city of LA 5-championships. Thus the Hall of Famer understands the role and responsibilities of representing an iconic franchise like the Lakers. Magic’s relationship with the Lakers wasn’t only limited to that of a player. The three-time MVP also served as a coach and president for the team. Thus it was no surprise to see the 63-year-old express his disappointment with the current situation, addressing the Westbrook situation at length. . gives Russell Westbrook advice after he was once boo’d \u0026 called Tragic Magic: “First off, take accountability. If you don’t play well, admit it. Stop trying to fight the media and the fans and go out and perform.” — Club Shay Shay (@ClubShayShay) Having faced a similar situation to Westbrook in the 1984 finals against the Celtics, Magic believes Brodie needs to take responsibility for his actions and stop paying heed to the surrounding noise, stating that Lakers Nation knew their basketball. Though his resume is enough to validate his greatness, Magic did have his fair share of ups in downs. One such instance was his performance in Game Four of the 1984 Finals against the Celtics, earning him the nickname Tragic Johnson. The twelve-time All-Star would commit grave errors during the contest, which included Celtics center Robert Parish stealing the ball, followed by missing two free throws in overtime. This came at a time when Magic was already a two-time champion and Finals MVP. Nonetheless, the legendary point guard would come back stronger, defeating Larry Bird and co in the very next Finals (1985).

Kohli would then change gears in astonishing fashion, smacking 67 runs off his next 30 deliveries, including 36 runs off his last 11 balls, to finish on an unbeaten 82 off 53 balls, giving India an incredible four-wicket win. Former Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq was in awe of Kohli’s unbeaten knock , saying that the right-handed batter has his own class with an awe-inspiring ability to win matches single-handedly, especially when under pressure. “All credit for the (victory of) Indian team should be given to Virat Kohli. The way he played was fantastic. Virat is only this type of player and it’s not like that he did something which he has not done or can’t do. He played well and it was a superb knock. He has the potential that he can win matches single handedly. “There are many players who can win matches single-handedly. Some players cannot win matches despite scoring runs but there are some players who win such matches for their teams single-handedly and in pressure. Virat (Kohli) is such a player and has his own class,” said Inzamam on his Youtube channel ‘The Match Winner’. In a chasing masterclass for ages, laced with six fours and four sixes at a strike-rate of 154.72, Kohli slowly got India back in the chase and eventually get their campaign off to a winning start with unshakable belief and absolute trust in his abilities to enthrall 90,293 fans in the iconic stadium. Inzamam further claimed that Kohli’s good form, which has been present since the Asia Cup 2022 after a prolonged lean patch, can guide India to breaking their nine-year drought of an ICC trophy this year. “The Indian team is dangerous only on one condition: when Virat plays brilliantly. I am telling this clearly. There are many factors and people term other batsmen as dangerous but for me, Virat is zabardast (magnificent). If India has to win the World Cup, Virat’s performance like this can win them the World Cup. “If they think that they can win the World Cup without Virat, it’s not possible. Indian (team) performance is related to only one person. That’s Virat Kohli. India was struggling for a long time due to Virat’s poor form. Now he has come back (in good form) and it gives India an edge in upcoming matches in the World Cup.” Kohli was also involved in a 113-run stand with Hardik Pandya for the fifth wicket to lead India’s heroic recovery from 31/4, which also has the record of the highest partnership for any wicket for India against Pakistan in T20Is and set the base for a successful run chase. “Both Virat and Pandya were playing well in the partnership. The main thing was that Kohli maintained the flow after the fall of Pandya’s wicket. He did not let pressure overtake his mind. He had the pressure that he is the well set batsman but the way he played the last two overs was his class. The two sixes he hit off Haris Rauf, that was some class. “The good thing for India is that Virat has regained his form. And it happened in such a match against Pakistan. It could have happened in any World Cup match. But it happened in the first match against Pakistan only,” concluded Inzamam.

Pinto is also the global investment bank’s chief operating officer and CEO of its Corporate \u0026 Investment Bank. The 59-year-old executive grew up in Argentina as a child where inflation was often very high, he shared, noting that living with pervasive inflation was “very, very stressful.” Price increases in Argentina averaged more than 300% a year from 1975 to 1991. Pinto opined: That’s why when people say, ‘the Fed is too hawkish,’ I disagree. I think putting inflation back in a box is very important … If it causes a slightly deeper recession for a period of time, that is the price we have to pay. The JPMorgan president stressed that the Federal Reserve cannot allow inflation to become ingrained in the economy, emphasizing that a premature return to easier monetary policy risks repeating the mistakes of the 70s and 80s. Crypto Is ‘Kind of Irrelevant’ Commenting on cryptocurrency, the JPMorgan executive claims that there is little progress recently in terms of the institutional adoption of crypto. Pinto said: The reality is, the current form of crypto has become a small asset class that is kind of irrelevant in the scheme of things. However, he noted: “But the technology, the concepts, something is probably going to happen there; just not in its current form.” In contrast to Pinto’s belief, many big companies and banks are seeing increased institutional interest in crypto, and are ramping up their crypto services. Nasdaq established a crypto unit in September citing increased demand for digital assets among institutional investors. Financial giant State Street recently said that it sees unwaning demand from institutions. In May, Citi, Wells Fargo, and BNY Mellon invested in crypto firm Talos citing an acceleration in institutional adoption of crypto assets. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also believes that blockchain and decentralized finance (defi) are real. However, he said that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are “decentralized Ponzi schemes.” What do you think about the comments by JPMorgan Chase President Daniel Pinto?

The JIP-led group, which is the preferred bidder to take the Japanese industrial group private, plans to provide 1 trillion yen in cash, while seeking financing totaling 1.4 trillion yen from banks along with a committed line of credit of 200 billion yen in working capital, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. Toshiba, in its regular meeting with banks including Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. on Oct. 20, informed them that JIP is valuating the company at around 2.4 trillion yen and asked them to give financing support, the people said. Shares of Toshiba fell as much as 1.3% on Tuesday in Tokyo, giving the conglomerate a market value of about $15.6 billion. A bid at 2.4 trillion yen would be worth about 5,541 yen per share according to Bloomberg calculations, similar to Toshiba’s closing price of 5,391 per share on Monday. JIP has yet to finalize the equity commitments from its partners, while banks remain cautious about making binding commitments, the people said. Both the consortium led by JIP and a rival group led by state-backed investment fund Japan Investment Corp. will find it hard to meet a Nov. 7 deadline to line up commitment letters, Bloomberg News reported earlier. Considerations are still ongoing and there’s no certainty that talks will lead to any transaction, the people said. Toshiba could still decide to explore certain asset sales instead of a full sale of the business, they said. Spokespeople for JIP and SMBC declined to comment. A Toshiba spokesperson said in response to a Bloomberg News query that, as a general rule, they cannot answer information about candidates, including co-investors, as it may undermine a fair process. JIP is in talks to form a partnership with domestic companies including Orix Corp. and Chubu Electric Power Co. as well as global investment firms such as Baring Private Equity Asia and CVC Capital Partners, Bloomberg News has reported. That coalition has made a proposal that would keep Toshiba’s current business structure intact. Investors including Bain Capital and MBK Partners have discussed being involved in JIC’s rival bid group, people familiar with the matter have said.\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/asias-biggest-buyout-toshiba-valued-at-16-billion-by-jip-in-takeover-bid/","tags":[],"title":"Asia's biggest buyout: Toshiba valued at $16 billion by JIP in takeover bid"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Liz Truss reacts after Rishi Sunak becomes first Indian-origin British PM Rishi Sunak, 42, has become Britain's first Indian-origin Prime Minister after he won the race to lead the Conservative Party.\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/liz-truss-reacts-after-rishi-sunak-becomes-first-indian-origin-british-pm/","tags":[],"title":"Liz Truss reacts after Rishi Sunak becomes first Indian-origin British PM"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"MSU researchers receive $3 million NIH grant to study testosterone’s role in depression Major depressive disorder affects women twice as often as men, but researchers are still trying to identify the reasons why.\nMajor depressive disorder affects women twice as often as men, but researchers are still trying to identify the reasons why. Researchers at Michigan State University have recently received a $3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to continue their investigation of how male and female brains respond to stress differently and how testosterone could be the key to increasing resilience. The National Institute of Mental Health has begun to look at biological sex as a variable that could help explain some mental health disparities. Since 2016, A.J. Robison, an associate professor in the College of Natural Science and director of MSU's Neuroscience Program, and his team have been studying the effects of stress on the brain and discovered that sex and testosterone play a role. Through earlier research, we found there is a specific brain circuit in the hippocampus that is more excitable in female mice than in males. That circuit is regulated by testosterone.\" A.J. Robison, Associate Professor, College of Natural Science Robison's team includes his wife, Michelle Mazei-Robison, a co-principal investigator on the grant and associate chair of the physiology department in the College of Natural Science, along with graduate students Elizabeth \"Liz\" Williams, Claire Manning, Ivana Lakic and Chiho Sugimoto. Their research has shown that testosterone reduces the excitability of this brain circuit. \"I'm really excited to be a part of this innovative project to dissect mechanisms that contribute to sex differences in stress resiliency,\" Mazei-Robison said. \"These studies have the potential to identify targets that could be leveraged towards novel therapeutic strategies to treat mood disorders.\" Since testosterone is central to many functions in the body, the answer is not as simple as giving someone with depression a testosterone boost. By identifying how testosterone affects neurons in the circuit through either -; the signaling on the cell's surface or binding DNA in the cell's nucleus -; researchers can develop and leverage novel targets to treat depression in both sexes. \"Now, we want to know how testosterone is causing this change in the brain circuitry,\" Robison said. \"If we can figure that out, maybe one of those things is something we can use to create a female- or male-specific pharmacological treatment for depression.\" This research has also spawned new studies in related areas. For example, Andrew Eagle, a research associate in the Department of Physiology at MSU and former postdoctoral fellow of Robison, is studying how this same brain circuit is connected to the rewarding effects and relapse behaviors associated with cocaine use in the hopes of finding new treatments for substance use disorder.

This was the biggest Muhurat day gain for the sensex in terms of points, and the best in terms of percentage since 2008, index data showed.\nMUMBAI: Boosted by strong buying in banking and financial stocks, the sensex gained 525 points, or nearly 1%, to end at 59,832 during Monday’s special hour-long Muhurat trading session on the BSE. This was the biggest Muhurat day gain for the sensex in terms of points, and the best in terms of percentage since 2008, index data showed. The day also marked the start of ‘Vikram Samvat Year 2079’. Followed mainly by the Gujaratis who are a majority among the traders on Dalal Street, the Samvat year starts on the day of Diwali. Traditionally during the Muhurat session, individual traders and investors tend to buy stocks, even if in small quantities, and refrain from selling. Despite a sharp selloff in Hong Kong \u0026 Chinese markets and flat trading in European bourses, the sensex started Monday’s session on astrong note and remained in a narrow range before closing 0. 9% in the green. On the NSE, the broader Nifty closed 154 points, also 0. 9%, higher at 17,731. According to HDFC Securities MD \u0026 CEO Dhiraj Relli, the positive ending during the Muhurat session was in-line with most such sessions in the past. “Indices rose led by bank stocks, after a volatile year, aided by positive cues from European and US markets and despite the selloff in the Hong Kong and China markets. Investors hope that the positive sentiment could get carried into the new Samvat year despite some macro and global headwinds. ” On Friday, major US indices had rallied about 2% each. That turned out to be one of the main drivers for the sensex, market players said. And earlier on Monday, markets in Tokyo and Seoul closed in the green while Shanghai and Hong Kong ended sharply lower after the close of the Party Congress in China the previousevening. Hang Seng closed 6. 4% lower — its worst single-session percentage loss in a decade, reports said. The day’s winning session on Dalal Street added over Rs 2 lakh crore to investor’s wealth with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at more than Rs 279 lakh crore. Of the 30 sensex stocks, 28 closed with gains, BSE data showed. Among the sensex stocks, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and HDFC together accounted fornearly half of the index’s gains. On the other side, losses in HUL and Kotak Bank limited the sensex’s gains, according to BSE data. On the sectoral front, BSE’s indices for capital goods, industrials, financial services, banking and telecom industries closed with gains of over 1% each, while the gauge for the FMCG industry closed in the red, becoming the only sectoral index to do so. On the day of Diwali, the BSE also began trading in electronic gold receipts (EGRs), a new product that will offer a fresh avenue for investors, jewellers and institutions to invest in the yellow metal. Since 2015, the BSE has been working collaboratively with the regulator and all market participants across India to launch various gold-based products, the exchange said in a press release.\ntoi\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/sensex-makes-biggest-muhurat-gain-in-14-years/","tags":[],"title":"Sensex makes biggest Muhurat gain in 14 years"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Katrina Kaif-Vicky Kaushal celebrate Diwali with stunning photos, netizens say \u0026lsquo;Death hi ho gayi\u0026rsquo; Katrina Kaif and Vicky Kaushal celebrated their first Diwali together and one of Bollywood's most loved couples shared their photos on social media with the fans.

Scientists at deCODE genetics, a subsidiary of Amgen, publish today a large genome-wide association study on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Nature Genetics. Sequence variants that associate with NAFLD were identified, including rare, protective loss-of-function variants that point to potential drug targets. Plasma proteomic analyses provided further insight into the pathogenesis of NAFLD. NAFLD is a growing health problem and is estimated to affect up to 25% of the world's population. Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), when over 5% of the liver is fat with no identifiable causes such as excessive alcohol consumption, is the first stage of NAFLD. NAFL can progress to non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH) which can progress further into liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD can be difficult to diagnose and monitor and there is currently no therapy available. The identification of potential drug targets and biomarkers is therefore of great importance. A large genome-wide association study of NAFL, liver cirrhosis and HCC was conducted and the findings integrated with expression and proteomic data. For NAFL, 9,491 clinical cases from Iceland, UK, USA and Finland were utilized in addition to proton density fat fraction (PDFF) extracted from 36,116 liver MRIs. Among the sequence variants discovered, in the Icelandic population, were rare, protective, predicted loss-of-function variants in MTARC1 and GPAM suggesting that inhibiting MTARC1 or GPAM could be therapeutic for NAFL or NASH. Levels of thousands of proteins measured in plasma were analyzed, identifying potential biomarkers of disease, disease progression or target engagement and models that can discriminate between a NAFL and cirrhosis were constructed using the proteomics data. The results therefore provide a path to the development of non-invasive tools to evaluate and diagnose NAFLD. Additionally, the pleiotropic effects of the identified variants were explored by looking at associations with 52 other phenotypes and traits. BMI is one of the most common risk factors of NAFLD and longitudinal PDFF measures suggested that carriers of p.Ile148Met, the well-know NAFLD risk variant, in PNPLA3 are more susceptible to change in BMI than non-carriers. To date this study is one of the largest ones conducted on the genetic basis of NAFLD and the results will hopefully contribute to the development of diagnostic tools and therapies that can help patients suffering from NAFLD. deCODE genetics Sveinbjornsson, G., et al.

University of Iowa researchers have traced where that reaction to a threat arises.\nAt one time or another, we've all felt paralyzed by a threat or danger. University of Iowa researchers have traced where that reaction to a threat arises. In a new study, the researchers confirmed a neural circuit linking two separate regions in the brain governs how animals, including humans, react to a stressful situation. Through experiments, the researchers showed how rats responded to a threat either passively or actively-;and linked each reaction to a specific pathway in the brain. In another test, the researchers successfully manipulated the neural circuit, so that rats overcame what would have been a paralyzing response to a danger and instead responded aggressively to the threat. The neural circuit identified with stress response connects the caudal medial prefrontal cortex to the midbrain dorsolateral periaqueductal gray. Clinching the connection, and how it regulates stress, is important, due to the known physical- and mental-health impacts of chronic stress. A lot of chronic stress diseases like depression and anxiety disorders are associated with what we call a passive coping behavior. We know that a lot of these conditions are caused by life stress. The simplest reason we're interested in this pathway is thinking about it as a circuit that can promote resilience against stress.\" Jason Radley, Associate Professor, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and the Study's Corresponding Author Previous research has identified the caudal medial prefrontal cortex-midbrain dorsolateral periaqueductal gray as a key pathway governing how animals respond to stress. Radley's team confirmed the pathway's importance by inactivating it, then observing how the rats responded to a threat. The rats could respond in two basic ways: One is passively, meaning in essence they did not move in response to the threat. The other is actively, through a range of behaviors, such as burying the threat (a shock probe, in the experiments), rearing up on hind legs, or seeking an escape route. The researchers learned that when they inactivated the rats' stress neural circuit, the animals responded passively, meaning they did not directly respond to the threat. \"That shows this pathway is necessary for active coping behavior,\" Radley says. Next, the researchers forced the rats to respond passively, by removing the bedding in their cage, which prevents them from trying to bury the threat mechanism. When the team activated the neural pathway, the rats switched their behavior, and responded actively to the threat. The active response occurred even though the animals were left without their bedding, which should have triggered a passive reply. Moreover, blood samples taken before and after the rats' neural circuits had been activated showed their stress hormone levels did not spike when confronted with the threat. \"What that means is by activating the pathway, we saw broad stress-buffering effects,\" Radley says. \"It not only revived the rats' active coping behaviors, it also restored them and greatly decreased stress hormone release.\" In a third set of experiments, the researchers subjected rats to chronic variable stress, meaning they were exposed to regular stress over two weeks. After the two-week conditioning, the rats were placed in cages and exposed to the threat. They responded passively, unwilling to move, and their stress hormones shot up, as the researchers had hypothesized. The chronic stress test is important, Radley says, because humans face chronic stress. For reasons that are unknown, some people continue to carry those stress burdens, which can lead to physical and mental disorders. Others, though, show little to no past memory of the chronic stress. The researchers term this behavior \"stress resilience.\" \"It's possible we can co-opt some of these brain circuits if we could understand the processes in the brain that can regulate resilience,\" Radley says, though he adds this is not an imminent option. The researchers plan to investigate the neutral connections that are upstream and downstream of the caudal medial prefrontal cortex-midbrain dorsolateral periaqueductal gray pathway. \"We don't understand how these effects are altering the brain more widely,\" Radley says. The study, \"Activity in a prefrontal-periaqueductal gray circuit overcomes behavioral and endocrine features of the passive coping stress response,\" was published online Oct. 28 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) .

In time for the 1400 local time Monday deadline, Sir Graham Brady, chair of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, announced in the Parliament complex that he had received only one nomination and therefore Sunak is the winner of the leadership contest. This means Sunak is poised to walk through the door of 10 Downing Street in London after an audience with King Charles III in Buckingham Palace, the timeframe of which will become known soon. 1. Rishi Sunak was, until recently, widely regarded as the party’s brightest rising star, the best-known of potential leadership contenders — and the bookies’ favorite to succeed Johnson. 2. Rishi Sunak is married to British-Indian fashion designer Akshata Murthy, daughter of founder of the Indian multi-national IT company Infosys. 3. Sunak, 42, was thrust into the spotlight when he became treasury chief in 2020, tasked with the unenviable job of steering the economy through its worst economic slump on record because of the pandemic. 4. He dished out billions of pounds in emergency spending to help businesses and workers, and his policies have generally been seen in a positive light. 5. But “partygate” changed those fortunes. Like Johnson, he was issued a police fine for attending a lockdown-flouting birthday party at Downing Street in June 2020. 6. Rishi Sunak has also come under heavy criticism for being slow to respond to Britain’s severe cost-of-living crisis. 7. Born to Indian parents who moved to the UK from East Africa, Sunak attended the exclusive Winchester College private school and studied at Oxford. 8. Some see his elite education and past work for the investment bank Goldman Sachs and a hedge fund as a deficit because he seems out of touch with ordinary voters. 9. Sunak also faced pressure following revelations that his wife, Akshata Murthy, avoided paying U.K. taxes on her overseas income, and that the former investment banker held on to his U.S. green card while serving in government. 10. The 42-year-old British Indian minister posted his resignation letter on Twitter soon after another senior Cabinet colleague, UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid, resigned.

ICP monitoring is thus a key aspect of patient care in patients with these disorders. Additionally, ICP measurements are relevant when estimating cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), an indicator of cerebral autoregulation (CA). CPP is linked to neuronal function and neurovascular coupling, and CA defines how the brain maintains a constant blood flow. Given these broad implications and applications in clinical decision-making, precise ICP monitoring is a vital patient management tool. While current tools for ICP monitoring are precise, they can cause hemorrhage or infections and are time-consuming. Although noninvasive alternatives exist, they have limitations such as poor generalizability, low predictive capacity, and a lack of reliability. Thus, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) are emerging as promising noninvasive solutions. Notably, NIRS has several advantages over other noninvasive methods-;low cost, bedside compatibility for long-term and continuous monitoring, along with user independence. In a new study published in Neurophotonics , researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) successfully deployed a NIRS device to continuously monitor hemoglobin concentration changes. The team built on previous research where they estimated ICP from cardiac waveform features measured using DCS, and also identified the correlation between relative changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration and ICP. But how were they able to measure ICP using the NIRS data? First author on the study, Filip Relander, explains, \"We developed and trained a random forest (RF) regression algorithm to correlate the morphology of cardiac pulse waveforms obtained through NIRS with intracranial pressure.\" To validate their algorithm, they conducted preliminary tests in a preclinical model. They measured fluctuations in invasive ICP and arterial blood pressure while profiling the changes in hemoglobin concentrations. Following this, they examined the performance of signals derived from the hemoglobin concentration and CBF to accurately verify the precision of their algorithm. From a proof-of-concept standpoint, the results were very promising. There was a high correlation between the ICP estimated using the RF algorithm and the actual ICP measured using invasive techniques. We showed, by validating the findings with invasive ICP data, that the trained RF algorithm applied to NIRS based cardiac waveforms can be used to estimate ICP with a high degree of precision.\" Jana Kainerstorfer, Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at CMU and Study's Senior Author Furthermore, the results indicated that the RF algorithm could interpret waveform features extracted from both NIRS and DCS, highlighting its useability. The parameters used in the algorithm can be obtained from NIRS measurements, combined with electrocardiograms and mean arterial blood pressure, which are regularly used for clinical evaluation. Thus, if this RF-based platform can produce robust ICP measurements in subsequent human trials, its potential for clinical use would be tremendous. According to Neurophotonics Associate Editor Rickson C. Mesquita, Professor at the University of Campinas, \"Assessing ICP noninvasively is of great value for monitoring patients in a critical condition, such as those in the intensive care unit. The future of NIRS in this space is exciting!\" SPIE--International Society for Optics and Photonics Relander, F.A.J., et al.

In this spectacular albeit full-of-drama match, Virat Kohli played one of his best innings, scoring an unbeaten 82 runs off 53 balls to help India win off the last ball of the game. However, it seemed the match had gone out of the hands for India when seasoned Dinesh Karthik got stumped out in the penultimate delivery of the match. Ravichandran Ashwin came in when India needed 2 runs off the last ball to win this match. The spinner did not succumb to a rush of blood and used his brain brilliantly to pull the match into India’s lap. #RAshwin 's presence of mind #INDvsPAK #Kingkohli #ViratKohli #GOAT pic.twitter.com/Mb3LgrQ3Wz — rohit_msdian (@rohit_601) October 23, 2022 The Player-of-the-Match Kohli praised Ashwin for leaving a delivery bowled by Pakistan’s Muhammad Nawaz in the last over, which went on to be declared wide. From India needing 5 runs to win in three balls before that delivery was bowled, the equation came down to 2 needed in as many deliveries. While Karthik was stumped out on the next delivery, Ashwin kept his nerve to guide India to victory with a lofted shot over mid-off on the last ball. “I told Ashwin to hit...ball over covers. But Ash...usne dimaag ke upar extra dimag lagaya. That was a brave thing for him to do...The ball came inside the line and he turned it into wide,” Kohli said. Kohli said this was his best innings in T20 cricket considering the situation it came in. “Till today I have always said Mohali was my best innings, against Australia: I got 82 off 52 (51 balls). Today I got 82 off 53. So they are exactly the same innings, but I think today I will count this one higher because of the magnitude of the game and what the situation was,” he said. Kohli thanked his fans for their support during his difficult times. “You guys have supported me, shown me so much love and support for all these months that I was kind of struggling, you guys kept backing me. And I am very grateful for your support. Thank you,” said Kohli in the post-match presentation ceremony on Sunday.

To date, accessory makers have expressed frustration to AppleInsider about their lack of ability to create MagSafe chargers with other colors or different surface materials. They all have to have a white silicone charging surface which doesn't always mesh with a product's aesthetic. That is about to change. AppleInsider has been able to confirm that Apple has made some changes to its MFi program and introduced a new MagSafe module that can be covered and styled with different materials. Apple's official MFi components Any third-party manufacturer that hopes to create an accessory that uses any of Apple's connectivity methods needs to use Apple's official components and complete a rigorous certification process. Consider the Apple Watch charging puck — Apple supplies the proprietary charging module directly to the manufacturers to build into their products. And, the same goes for the Lightning connector. Then Apple takes the product and runs it through various safety and performance tests before certifying it and assigning it a dedicated ID. Apple's coveted MFi branding logos This ensures the charger is safe for your device, performs to Apple's standards, and is the same quality as if you're buying from Apple directly. You'll know one of these tested and certified devices by the tell-tale Made for iPhone (or Made for Apple Watch) logo on the side of the box. Manufacturers go to great lengths — and significant expense — to get this badge of honor and is a sign of reliability to consumers. Because MagSafe falls into this category, until recently Apple-certified MagSafe chargers to date have the same bright white, soft-touch, MagSafe surface. The charger you get from Nomad or Belkin works, looks, and feels just like Apple's but with a different design. The state of MagSafe With MagSafe, things can be confusing. Apple offers two methods of wirelessly charging iPhones with users having the choice between Qi and MagSafe. MagSafe components If you've ever come across a magnetic wireless charger that doesn't carry the Made for iPhone badge, it's just a 7.5W Qi charger with a ring of magnets. This differs from MagSafe which can charge at up to 15W. Now, Apple is introducing a new official MFi MagSafe component. As it is an official part, it has fast charging speeds but Apple will now allow the charging surface to be covered. This will pave the way for a whole new world of MagSafe chargers that don't have to be stark white and instead can be styled in all sorts of different ways. We can have MagSafe with dark profiles, premium leather surfaces, or covered in fun patterns. Anker 3-in-1 Cube with MagSafe We've already seen the first of these chargers in Anker's new 3-in-1 MagSafe cube . This ditches the white circle for a more seamless top surface with a raised rubber ring. This is the only MagSafe charger that delivers 15W of power with a non-white surface. Other accessory makers that have spoken to AppleInsider with the promise of anonymity have said they're already working on new devices with hidden MagSafe chargers. MagSafe didn't gain any new features with the iPhone 14 series but at least accessories will be getting a whole new look. Third-party MagSafe accessories are about to look a lot nicer Third-party MagSafe chargers are about to become much more varied, as Apple is now offering an updated MagSafe module to manufacturers that isn't the bright white circle that has been standard since launch.

The effects – most notably evidence of mitochondrial disruption and dysregulated choline and triglyceride levels in brain tissue – were greater in male offspring than in females. The work adds to the body of evidence that both OPFRs and BFRs can be neurotoxic. FM 550 is a flame-retardant mixture first identified a decade ago. It was developed to replace PBDEs, a class of fire retardants being phased out due to safety concerns. While some new flame retardant mixtures still contain BFRs, the OPFRs are a popular substitute for PBDEs, since it is believed that OPFRs don't accumulate in the body and thus cannot be as harmful. Specifically, it was thought that OPFRs wouldn't impact acetylcholinesterase – a key neurotransmitter. But it looks as though OPFRs still impact choline signaling and are just as bad if not worse than PBDEs for the developing brain.\" Heather Patisaul, Associate Dean for Research in NC State's College of Sciences and Corresponding Author of the Study Patisaul and her colleagues performed transcriptomic and lipidomic studies on the prefrontal cortexes of newborn rats whose mothers had been exposed to FM550, or to BFR or OPFR elements individually, during gestation. \"Getting genetic information from transcriptomics is what researchers commonly do to tease out potential connections between toxicity and health effects,\" Patisaul says. \"In this case, we also wanted to see if the lipid, or fat, composition of the brain was altered – our brains are essentially balls of fat, and lipidomics can reveal how exposure may affect the brain in its earliest developmental stages.\" Both the transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses showed evidence of mitochondrial disruption, although the disruptions were more pronounced in the offspring that had been exposed to OPFRs. Mitochondria are found in almost every cell and serve as cells' energy generators, playing a vital role in cellular respiration. The transcriptomic analysis found disruption of cellular respiration genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and ALS, while lipidomics pointed to disrupted choline and triglyceride levels in the brain. In males exposed to OPFRs, genes associated with axon guidance and choline signaling were also dysregulated. Axon guidance is the process by which neurons make the proper connections during neural development. Choline is a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which affects critical aspects of neuron function and neuronal signaling. \"That so many altered genes are involved in respiration and choline, there is concern that these FRs impair basic autonomic function and cognition,\" Patisaul says. \"So, the bottom line is that exposure to BFRs and OPFRs is disrupting both neuronal signaling and the ability of cells to properly produce and utilize energy.\" The researchers also found that male offspring were more affected than females. \"In earlier rat studies, we found that OPFR levels are higher in placentas attached to males than females,\" Patisaul says. \"So that difference in exposure could be why we see different and more severe effects in males. \"The important message here is that the presumption that OPFRs are safer that other FRs is likely wrong. Both OPFRs and BFRs can disrupt cortical development and function. And the fact that these chemicals are detectable in the placenta means they aren't breaking down quickly enough to do no damage.\" The work appears in a special issue of Neuroendocrinology , and was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Read on as we detail the first iPhone apps to support these features with iOS 16.1. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); For those unfamiliar, Live Activities is a feature available for all iPhone models running iOS 16 that shows useful app information right on the lock screen. At first, only a few Apple apps, such as Music and Clock, had Live Activities. But with iOS 16.1, developers can also integrate their apps with this feature. At the same time, apps supporting Live Activities can also show the same information on Dynamic Island for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max users. We’ve selected some of the first apps to introduce support for the Live Activities and Dynamic Island APIs. Flighty is a great iOS app that helps users keep track of all their upcoming flights through a beautiful and intuitive interface. With its latest update, Flighty can now automatically show details about your upcoming flight right on the lock screen of your iPhone three hours before departure. Flight status can also be quickly viewed on Dynamic Island by iPhone 14 Pro users. Flighty is available for free on the App Store , although some features require a subscription. The app also works with iPad and Mac. Carrot Weather is a popular iOS and macOS app that shows the weather forecast in a fun way. The new version of the app lets users check details about specific alerts, such as the possibility of rain, directly from the lock screen of their iPhone or Dynamic Island. The app is also available for free on the App Store , but some features (including access to Live Activities) require a subscription. Carrot Weather is also compatible with the iPad and Apple Watch. SmartGym is known for helping iPhone, iPad, and especially Apple Watch users track their workouts with details about weightlifting, bodyweight workouts, and more. The new update supports Live Activities to show details of a workout in progress right on the iPhone lock screen or Dynamic Island. The latest SmartGym update also optimizes the app to work with Apple Watch Ultra and the new Action Button. SmartGym is a free download for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac from the App Store with in-app purchases for the Premium plan to unlock all of the app’s features. Aviary is a third-party Twitter client for iOS, macOS, and even watchOS. Recently, the app has been completely rebuilt with a more modern interface. Now the app has been updated with support for edited tweets as well as a Live Activity and a button on Dynamic Island to “Undo Tweet.” If you wrote something wrong or regret that tweet, you can quickly cancel it. Aviary is available on the App Store for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. The app is free to download, but it requires a paid subscription. Soor is one of many apps that extend the functionality of Apple Music for iPhone and iPad users. It works as a complete replacement for the native Music app on iOS. The new version of Soor now lets users see song lyrics in real time with Live Activities and Dynamic Island. The app is available on the App Store as a one-time purchase of $6.99, which unlocks the full experience on both iPhone and iPad. TV Remote is a simple but useful iOS app that lets users control their Smart TVs directly from an iPhone or iPad. Earlier this year, the app was updated with theme options, custom layout, and widgets. Now TV Remote also works with Live Activities, so it shows quick access to some remote control buttons right from the iPhone lock screen or Dynamic Island. TV Remote 2 is now available for free on the App Store . However, in order to unlock some of the features such as themes and widgets, users must subscribe to TV Remote Premium. Pestle lets users import recipes from any website, and the app turns them into a step-by-step process automatically. The app will then scan the recipe for ingredients, steps, nutritional information, and more. With its latest update, Pestle shows the current step of a recipe with a timer right from the lock screen or Dynamic Island for those with an iPhone 14 Pro. You can download Pestle for free on the App Store , although some features are only available through in-app purchases.

Being the best marksman we’ve ever witnessed shoot the ball, the Golden State Warriors leader has managed to revolutionize the NBA. Since stepping foot onto the hardwood in 2009, The Baby-Faced Assassin used his accurate shooting as an unfair advantage over his opponents and managed to rack up a pretty illustrious resume. A staked trophy cabinet of Chef Curry’s is highlighted with his 2 MVPs, 4 championships, and 1 Finals MVP, among a long list of other impressive accolades. Over the past few years, especially after GSW’s first championship run, we saw Steph hit turnaround three-pointers. However, back in 2013, when the sharpshooter wasn’t the established superstar he is today, the shifty guard bring out the famous move. Curry was absolutely sensational during GSW’s first-round clash against the Nuggets back in the 2013 Playoffs. In the 6 games, the scrawny 6-foot-3 PG went on to record 24.3/4.3/9.3 on an extremely efficient 46.8/44.2/100 shooting split. However, there was one specific play during the series, that left the entire Denver squad in awe of a younger Curry’s greatness. According to Andre Iguodala, it was SC30’s turnaround three-pointer, which he has popularized recently, that left the Nuggets bench stunned. In an appearance on “ ”, Iggy detailed: The play Andre is talking about occurred midway into the 3rd quarter of Game 1. Here, have a look at the clip. Here’s the play, for those wondering. Game 4, 1st round, 2013 playoffs. — Tommy Gunn (@tgunn21) Yes, when Curry entered the 2009 Draft, he was undeniably the best shooter of the class. However, no one could have possibly imagined that the former Davidson Wildcat would end up becoming the three-point GOAT. Apart from being the only player in history to surpass the 3,000 3-pointers mark, the Warriors icon has virtually all shooting records under his belt.

For a recently published paper, the researchers reviewed the scientific literature on the effects of fire on forest composition and structure and its influence on ticks and their wildlife hosts. They concluded that prescribed burning can help restore forest habitats to a state less favorable to several species of disease-carrying ticks and could be an effective management tactic for reducing their populations. The era of fire suppression, which began roughly in the early 1900s and has continued for more than a century, changed the species composition of Eastern forests, creating habitats and microclimates that favored the survival and spread of ticks, noted lead author Michael Gallagher, research ecologist at the Silas Little Experimental Forest, Northern Research Station, U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, New Lisbon, New Jersey. \"Before the arrival of Europeans, Eastern forests were 'fire-dependent,' characterized by fire-tolerant species such as pine, oak and chestnut,\" Gallagher said. \"Frequent low-to-moderate intensity fires would have fostered dry conditions, thinned the understory and diminished layers of leaf litter, which in turn would have created microclimates with lower humidity and higher temperatures. \"These lower-moisture, higher-temperature -; or xeric -; conditions were likely to limit ticks' activity, interaction with reservoir hosts and overall populations,\" he said. Since fire has been suppressed and forests have recovered significantly from periods of deforestation caused by logging and agricultural land-clearing, fire-sensitive mesic forest species -; those that thrive in and contribute to moister environments -; have become dominant, a process known as mesophication, he explained. This mesophication of forests has been widely observed throughout the eastern United States. In the absence of fire, these mesic habitats moderate forest temperatures and humidity, promote denser understory growth, and cause greater moisture retention in forest litter. This creates microclimates within the ideal range for tick survival and optimizes conditions for ticks to 'quest,' or seek hosts.\" Michael Gallagher, Lead Author The number of tick-borne disease cases in the United States has trended higher in recent decades, ranging to as high as nearly 60,000 annually and accounting for more than 75% of vector-borne disease cases, according to the researchers, who published their analysis in Ecological Applications . Tick-borne pathogens can cause Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Powassan disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia and other illnesses. \"Research suggests that conditions contributing to this rise in cases resulted from climate change, growth of certain wildlife populations, land-use change and, likely, forest change due to the decline of fire frequency,\" said co-author Erika Machtinger, assistant professor of entomology in Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences. \"These changes have created conditions known to drive tick abundance, tick-wildlife host interactions and expansion of ticks' geographic range.\" In addition to fire's direct effect on tick survival by subjecting them to heat high enough to cause mortality, several indirect effects of fire-driven forest modification can suppress tick abundance and pathogen transmission, she said. \"Reductions in canopy and understory density and the creation of gap space from prescribed burning can increase sun exposure and wind speed and reduce evapotranspiration from plants, promoting hotter and drier conditions during the daytime and colder temperatures at night,\" said Machtinger, who directs the college's Veterinary Entomology Laboratory. \"These more frequent moisture and temperature extremes can exceed tick tolerances and affect behavior, development time, molting and overall survival.\" She also pointed out that thinner layers of leaf litter due to burning could reduce insulation and lower the temperature of soils where ticks overwinter, causing higher mortality. In addition, studies indicate that fire-driven habitat change is likely to increase the population of certain wildlife predators of ticks, such as red imported fire ants and bobwhite quail. \"On the other hand, reduced woody plant density and debris as a result of fire actually may decrease populations of some small mammal hosts of ticks by removing cover and making them more vulnerable to predation,\" Machtinger said. \"This would reduce ticks' interaction with hosts that serve as reservoirs of disease pathogens.\" The researchers noted that the current paradigm for tick-borne disease control places nearly all the burden on the individual to prevent tick bites, while broader-scale tick management by professionals has been insufficient to stem increases in tick-borne pathogen transmission. \"Although the fire suppression era persists in many parts of the United States, prescribed burns have been used successfully in a growing number of fire-suppressed landscapes in recent decades,\" Gallagher said. \"We believe there's an opportunity to reduce the number of ticks by using prescribed fire to restore the health of forest ecosystems, and we think this approach can be integrated as part of a multipronged strategy for managing ticks and tick-borne diseases.\" Other co-authors of the paper are Jesse Kreye, assistant professor of fire and natural resources management, and Nathaniel Schmidt, former master's degree student, Penn State; Alexis Everland, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Forest Fire Service, New Lisbon, New Jersey; and Nicholas Skowronski, USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Morgantown, West Virginia.

The allegations further claim that between May 2020 and February 2022 particularly, Fitbit made representations to Aussie consumers that they wouldn’t be entitled to any refund for a faulty product if seeking to make a return after 45 days from the date of purchase or shipment. This is the second time Fitbit has been slammed by the ACCC, following very similar allegations made against the wearable manufacturer in 2018 (opens in new tab) . “Fitbit has again come to the ACCC’s attention for allegedly misleading consumers about their consumer guarantee rights,” said ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb in a statement, “We are taking this case against Fitbit because we consider the alleged conduct is serious and that manufacturers should have processes in place that ensure compliance with the Australian Consumer Law.” When sought for comment, a Fitbit spokesperson told TechRadar Australia, “Fitbit will be reviewing the ACCC’s allegations and does not have further comments to share at this time.” Google could not be reached for comment at time of publication. Under Australian consumer law, a customer’s rights in respect to a faulty product are not limited by any time periods, either from date of purchase or otherwise. The law further enforces that businesses and manufacturers who sell a product with a major problem, or which develops a major problem, must provide Aussie consumers with either a refund or offer of replacement. A deduction from a refund made based on how long a consumer has had a product before it develops a major problem is also not permitted under Australian consumer law. Fitbit’s new stoush with the Aussie watchdog adds to a rough few months for the fitness tracker giant, having been faced with troubling issues plaguing its existing products while continuing to lose ground in the wearables market to the Apple Watch and seeing fellow competitor Samsung gaining considerable momentum with its Galaxy Watch offerings. Meanwhile, Google’s other entry into the wearables space – the Google Pixel Watch – has faced some issues of its own despite an initially warm reception upon its release. Given the importance of fitness tracking to wearables, and Google’s ownership of the pioneers in the fitness tracking space (aka Fitbit), reports of persistent issues (opens in new tab) with the Pixel Watch’s tracking of calories burned would be cause for concern to the tech giant. Poor battery life has also been a constant complaint since the Pixel Watch’s release, an issue similarly faced by primary competitor the Apple Watch when compared to wearables with less functions such as those in the Fitbit range. Likewise, user reception pointing out how poorly the Pixel Watch manages to differentiate itself from competitors or demonstrate any advantage has led to considerable disappointment given the hype ahead of the watch’s release. While the aforementioned issues don’t come under consumer law protections, this legal battle could be cause for concern and hopefully a prod for Google to improve its entries in the wearables market, with Fitbit’s ability to comply with consumer laws likely one such area now high on the agenda. The ACCC is seeking penalties, injunctions, a compliance program and other orders against Fitbit, with adjustments expected to be made for future proceedings given that Fitbit is based in the United States.\ntechradar\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/fitbit-set-for-legal-faceoff-with-australian-watchdog-over-refund-and-repla/","tags":[],"title":"Fitbit set for legal faceoff with Australian watchdog over refund and replacement policy"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"Researchers study the effects of alcohol intake and seek better treatment for alcoholic pancreatitis Many alcoholic pancreatitis patients continued drinking during COVID-19. University of Miami Miller School of Medicine researchers study the effects of continued alcohol intake and seek better treatment for alcohol-associated pancreatic disease.\nMany alcoholic pancreatitis patients continued drinking during COVID-19. University of Miami Miller School of Medicine researchers study the effects of continued alcohol intake and seek better treatment for alcohol-associated pancreatic disease. Researchers at the Miller School are looking for solutions to the continued effects of alcohol use, its harmful impact, and treatment. Understanding the mechanisms of alcohol abuse has gained importance, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher alcohol consumption led to an increased burden of pancreatic diseases in society. In a study titled \"Urolithin A attenuates severity of chronic pancreatitis associated with continued alcohol intake by inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling,\" published in the American Journal of Physiology – Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology , researchers examine the short- and long-term consequences of this increased alcohol effect on pancreatic diseases and work together on innovative approaches to better understand how to treat pancreatitis patients with continued alcohol intake. Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas often associated with long-term alcohol consumption, a potential risk factor for the induction of acute pancreatitis. Recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis results in chronic pancreatitis. Each year, about 275,000 hospital stays for acute pancreatitis and 86,000 hospital stays for chronic pancreatitis occur across the U.S., according to the statistics released by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Acute pancreatitis appears suddenly and can typically be resolved in days with treatment in most patients. However, acute pancreatitis can also cause severe life-threatening conditions in some cases. Recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis instigate irreversible damage to the pancreas, causing weight loss, pain, diabetes, and even pancreatic cancer. Total alcohol sales almost tripled in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic, subsequently increasing the number of patients diagnosed with alcohol-associated pancreatitis. Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with 40-70% of pancreatitis cases. Without moderation, alcohol use harshly impacts both the liver and pancreas, causing fat accumulation and inflammation, disrupting normal function. With repeated episodes of binge drinking (four to five drinks in two hours), the pancreas eventually builds up scar tissues with persistent inflammation, weakening its endocrine and exocrine functions needed to digest food and regulate blood sugar levels. This chronic insult to the organ can cause excruciating pain, malnutrition, diabetes, and death. We are developing novel models to study and to prevent inflammation or reverse the pancreatic damage caused due to excess alcohol intake.\" Nagaraj Nagathihalli, Ph.D., Lead Author, Associate Professor of Surgery, DeWitt Daughtry Family Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology Accumulating scientific evidence suggests that continued alcohol consumption with established alcoholic pancreatitis instigates irreversible pancreatic damage due to recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis by fostering a continuous fibro-inflammatory microenvironment within the pancreas. \"The molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of alcoholic pancreatitis with continuous alcohol intake remains ambiguous; treatment options and preventative care strategies are restricted due to limited experimental animal models that successfully recapitulate human pancreatitis arising from prolonged or continued alcohol use after established pancreatic injury,\" said Dr. Nagathihalli. \"In this study, using an established alcoholic pancreatitis mice model, we have addressed two of the major unanswered questions with regards to the pathogenesis of pancreatitis. We've characterized the pancreas-specific signaling pathways in this process and determined if utilizing novel therapeutic agents can attenuate the severity of alcoholic pancreatitis progression, despite continued alcohol triggers\" said first author of the study Siddharth Mehra, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the Miller School's Department of Surgery. The microbiome has been implicated in gastrointestinal inflammation as a critical mediator of overall gut health. Urolithin A is a natural compound synthesized by gut bacteria from ingested ellagitannins, a class of hydrolyzable tannins found mainly in pomegranate, berries, and nuts. Previous work from the group has shown that Urolithin A is a potent anti-inflammatory agent in several pre-clinical disease models and exhibits anti-tumor activity in gastrointestinal cancers. \"Our studies have demonstrated that Urolithin A is well tolerated and does not elicit any adverse toxic effects at clinically relevant doses in mice. However, despite the promising effect of Urolithin A in several malignancies and inflammatory disorders, the benefit of this microbial metabolite in the prevention of pancreatitis had not been investigated,\" says Dr. Nagathihalli. The FDA recognizes Urolithin A as a \"safe dietary supplement.\" \"In animal experiments, we have shown that Urolithin A can help improve the effectiveness of treating alcoholic pancreatitis despite continued alcohol intake,\" said Dr. Mehra.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, heart attacks were the leading cause of death worldwide but were steadily on the decline. However, the new study-;recently published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Medical Virology -; shows that heart attack death rates took a sharp turn and increased for all age groups during the pandemic. The spikes in heart attack deaths have tracked with surges of COVID-19 infection-;even during the presumed less-severe Omicron phase of the pandemic. Furthermore, the data showed the increase was most significant among individuals ages 25-44, who are not usually considered at high risk for heart attack. The dramatic rise in heart attacks during the pandemic has reversed what was a prior decadelong steady improvement in cardiac deaths. We are still learning the many ways by which COVID-19 affects the body, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or race.\" Yee Hui Yeo, MD, Study's First Author and Cedars-Sinai Physician-Scientist Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Vital Statistics System, the Cedars-Sinai researchers identified 1,522,699 deaths from heart attacks-;medically called acute myocardial infarctions-;between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2022. Investigators then compared age-related mortality rates between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, as well as demographic groups and regions. Key findings from the study include: \"There are several potential explanations for the rapid rise in cardiac deaths in patients with COVID-19, yet still many unanswered questions,\" said Yeo. \"Importantly, our results highlight disparities in mortality that have emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic and that are persisting even through the Omicron era.\" The possible explanations, Yeo said, include that COVID-19 may trigger or accelerate the presentation of preexisting coronary artery disease, even in younger adults. Reasons for the spike in heart-related conditions could also be related to psychological and social challenges associated with the pandemic, including job loss and other financial pressures that can cause acute or chronic stress leading to cardiac disease. The research team members say they have long known that infections such as the flu can increase risk for heart disease and heart attack, but the sharp rise in heart attack deaths is like nothing seen before. \"There is something very different about how this virus affects the cardiac risks,\" said Susan Cheng, MD, MPH, director of the Institute for Research on Healthy Aging in the Department of Cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute and senior and co-corresponding author of the study. \"The difference is likely due to a combination of stress and inflammation, arising from predisposing factors and the way this virus biologically interacts with the cardiovascular system.\" Yeo, Cheng and the broader Smidt Heart Institute team hope that greater awareness and more research will expand the medical community's ability to manage and mitigate these risks.

Despite its prevalence and severity, however, the condition is difficult to diagnose and treat effectively. The disease can cause decreased blood flow to vital organs, inflammation throughout the body, and abnormal blood clotting. Therefore, if sepsis isn't recognized and treated quickly, it can lead to shock, organ failure, and death. But it can be difficult to identify which pathogen is causing sepsis, or whether an infection is in the bloodstream or elsewhere in the body. And in many patients with symptoms that resemble sepsis, it can be challenging to determine whether they truly have an infection at all. Now, researchers at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub (CZ Biohub), the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), and UC San Francisco (UCSF) have developed a new diagnostic method that applies machine learning to advanced genomics data from both microbe and host – to identify and predict sepsis cases. As reported on October 20, 2022 in Nature Microbiology , the approach is surprisingly accurate, and has the potential to far exceed current diagnostic capabilities. Sepsis is one of the top 10 public health issues facing humanity. One of the key challenges with sepsis is diagnosis. Existing diagnostic tests are not able to capture the dual-sided nature of the disease – the infection itself and the host's immune response to the infection.\" Chaz Langelier, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Author, Associate Professor of Medicine, UCSF's Division of Infectious Diseases and a CZ Biohub Investigator Current sepsis diagnostics focus on detecting bacteria by growing them in culture, a process that is \"essential for appropriate antibiotic therapy, which is critical for sepsis survival,\" according to the researchers behind the new method. But culturing these pathogens is time-consuming and doesn't always correctly identify the bacterium that is causing the infection. Similarly for viruses, PCR tests can detect that viruses are infecting a patient but don't always identify the particular virus that's causing sepsis. \"This results in clinicians being unable to identify the cause of sepsis in an estimated 30 to 50% of cases,\" Langelier said. \"This also leads to a mismatch in terms of the antibiotic treatment and the pathogen causing the problem.\" In the absence of a definitive diagnosis, doctors often prescribe a cocktail of antibiotics in an effort to stop the infection, but the overuse of antibiotics has led to increased antibiotic resistance worldwide. \"As physicians, we never want to miss a case of infection,\" said Carolyn Calfee, M.D., M.A.S., a professor of medicine and anesthesia at UCSF and co–senior author of the new study. \"But if we had a test that could help us accurately determine who doesn't have an infection, then that could help us limit antibiotic use in those cases, which would be really good for all of us.\" The researchers analyzed whole blood and plasma samples from more than 350 critically ill patients who had been admitted to UCSF Medical Center or the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital between 2010 and 2018. But rather than relying on cultures to identify pathogens in these samples, a team led by CZ Biohub scientists Norma Neff, Ph.D., and Angela Pisco, Ph.D., instead used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). This method identifies all the nucleic acids or genetic data present in a sample, then compares those data to reference genomes to identify the microbial organisms present. This technique allows scientists to identify genetic material from entirely different kingdoms of organisms – whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi – that are present in the same sample. However, detecting and identifying the presence of a pathogen alone isn't enough for accurate sepsis diagnosis, so the Biohub researchers also performed transcriptional profiling – which quantifies gene expression – to capture the patient's response to infection. Next they applied machine learning to the mNGS and transcriptional data to distinguish between sepsis and other critical illnesses and thus confirm the diagnosis. Katrina Kalantar, Ph.D., a lead computational biologist at CZI and co–first author of the study, created an integrated host–microbe model trained on data from patients in whom either sepsis or non-infectious systemic inflammatory illnesses had been established, which enabled sepsis diagnosis with very high accuracy. \"We developed the model by looking at a bunch of metagenomics data alongside results from traditional clinical tests,\" Kalantar explained. To start, the researchers identified changes in gene expression between patients with confirmed sepsis and non-infectious systemic inflammatory conditions that appear clinically similar, then used machine learning to identify the genes that could best predict those changes. The researchers found that when traditional bacterial culture identified a sepsis-causing pathogen, there was usually an overabundance of genetic material from that pathogen in the corresponding plasma sample analyzed by mNGS. With that in mind, Kalantar programmed the model to identify organisms present in disproportionately high abundance compared to other microbes in the sample, and to then compare those to a reference index of well-known sepsis-causing microbes. \"In addition to that, we also noted any viruses that were detected, even if they were at lower levels, because those really shouldn't be there,\" Kalantar explained. \"With this relatively straightforward set of rules, we were able to do pretty well.\" The researchers found that the mNGS method and their corresponding model worked better than expected: They were able to identify 99% of confirmed bacterial sepsis cases, 92% of confirmed viral sepsis cases, and were able to predict sepsis in 74% of clinically suspected cases that hadn't been definitively diagnosed. \"We were expecting good performance, or even great performance, but this was almost perfect,\" said Lucile Neyton, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Calfee lab and co–first author of the study. \"By using this approach, we get a pretty good idea of what is causing the disease, and we know with relatively high confidence if a patient has sepsis or not.\" The team was also excited to discover that they could use this combined host-response and microbe detection method to diagnose sepsis using plasma samples, which are routinely collected from most patients as part of standard clinical care. \"The fact that you can actually identify sepsis patients from this widely available, easy-to-collect sample type has big implications in terms of practical utility,\" Langelier said. The idea for the work stemmed from previous research by Langelier, Kalantar, Calfee, UCSF researcher and CZ Biohub President Joe DeRisi, Ph.D., and their colleagues, in which they used mNGS to effectively diagnose lower respiratory tract infections in critically ill patients. Because the method worked so well, \"we wanted to see if the same type of approach could work in the context of sepsis,\" said Kalantar. The team hopes to build upon this successful diagnostic technique by developing a model that can also predict antibiotic resistance from pathogens detected with this method. \"We've had some success doing that for respiratory infections, but no one has come up with a good approach for sepsis,\" Langelier said. Furthermore, the researchers hope to eventually be able to predict outcomes of patients with sepsis, \"such as mortality or length of stay in the hospital, which would provide key information that would allow clinicians to better care for their patients and match resources to the patients who need them the most,\" Langelier said. \"There's a lot of potential for novel sequencing approaches such as this to help us more precisely identify the causes of a patient's critical illness,\" added Calfee. \"If we can do that, it's the first step towards precision medicine and understanding what's going on at an individual patient level.\" Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Kalantar, K.L., et al.

The European Union (EU) is in the midst of working through a multi-pronged solution to ameliorate the negative effects of the present situation, which in the short term was a direct result of international sanctions on Russian energy following the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February this year. In the longer term, the long-running over-reliance on cheap Russian gas on the part of many EU states, including its de facto leader, Germany, is the key reason for the current disastrous energy crunch across the region. One key element of this multi-pronged EU plan is the imposition of a price cap on gas prices. However, three developments last week from Russia, Qatar, and China threaten to undermine the EU’s efforts to bring some stability to its gas market over the winter period, and to reduce the energy risk premium being priced into their economic outlooks and the pricing of their financial asset markets. The first of these is that Russia’s state-owned gas behemoth, Gazprom, has threatened to halt all of its gas supplies to the EU if a price cap on gas is introduced. Broadly speaking, gas imports from Russia made up around 40 percent of the EU’s gas supply in 2021, with the more specific details analysed by OilPrice.com recently, but have dropped to around 9 percent in recent weeks. According to Gazprom’s chief executive officer, Alexei Miller, last week, any such gas price cap would be a breach of contract on the part of EU buyers of Gazprom’s gas that would result in a suspension of gas supplies from the company. Although Russian gas deliveries to the EU via its Nord Stream and Yamal-Europe pipelines have been subject to repeated disruption since the invasion of Ukraine, and both routes are still currently closed off to Europe, Russian gas is still being delivered to selected European buyers through the Sudzha entry point on the border with Ukraine and the TurkStream pipeline. Related: Oil Tanker Market In Disarray As EU Ban On Russian Crude Nears On 18 October, the EU’s executive arm, the European Commission (EC), proposed further emergency measures to reduce the high energy prices that have caused a spike in inflation across the region and beyond, and a sharp rise in interest rates to combat it, with the economy- crimping effects that these can cause. Although steering clear of an outright cap on gas prices at that point, the EC did ask for the EU member states’ approval to draft a proposal to set a temporary ‘maximum dynamic price’ on trades at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) Dutch gas hub, which serves as a benchmark price for European gas trading. Other measures discussed at the meeting included energy regulators being tasked with launching an alternative benchmark price for liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 31 March 2023, and the launching a joint gas buying program among EU countries, in an effort to refill depleted storage caverns in time for next winter, and to allow for the negotiation of lower gas prices in the future. However, in a subsequent EU meeting that began on 20 October, German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, dropped his opposition to the imposition of an EU gas price cap, and EU leaders then agreed to work towards a cap that would “immediately limit episodes of excessive gas prices.” EC President, Charles Michel, underlined that the EU’s leaders had reached an agreement that would bring down prices, and added: “I think that we sent a clear signal to the markets that we are ready to act together, that we are able to act together.” According to the official minutes of this latest meeting, the EU’s leaders formally request that the EC works “urgently…on a temporary dynamic price corridor on natural gas transactions.” The previously floated idea of a mechanism to limit the price of gas used for electricity generation is also present in the minutes, as is the notion that member states pursue joint purchasing of gas, the development of a new benchmark for gas prices, and the increasing of efforts to reduce gas demand. Related: Colombia Is On The Brink Of An Energy Crisis All of which likely means that Russia will indeed cut off all supplies of gas to Europe at some point in the very near future for as long as it wishes, which, in turn, means that the EU will need to find other sources of substitute supply to bridge any supply transition gaps in the short-, medium-, and long-term. Qatar had been top of the list of such alternative supply sources, as highlighted by OilPrice.com, but, in the second setback for the EU’s energy security plans, it said last week that it will not divert any gas that is already under contract with Asian buyers to Europe this winter, regardless of any other considerations. Saad al-Kaabi, the chief executive of state-owned QatarEnergy, and also Energy Minister, said: “Qatar is absolutely committed to [the] sanctity of contracts... When we sign with an Asian buyer or European buyers, we stick to that agreement.” This statement of policy is a blow to hopes held by the EU in general, and by Germany in particular, that the emirate could be persuaded to do precisely the opposite of its stated intention, and divert supplies that had been destined for Asia to Europe instead, breaking contracts if necessary, for a hefty premium if required. Just last month, Qatar’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said that his country was in talks with several German companies about new liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies and sources spoken to last week by OilPrice.com confirmed that included among them are utilities giants, RWE and Uniper. The specific deals followed on from two major initiatives implemented by Germany in the wake of the sanctions on Russia. The first is focused on enhancing gas delivery mechanisms into Europe, with a declaration of intent on energy cooperation signed in May between Germany and Qatar aimed at ramping up LNG supplies going into Germany through existing importation routes augmented by new infrastructure. This includes the deployment of four floating LNG import facilities on its northern coast, and two permanent onshore terminals, which are under development, according to sources within the EU’s energy security apparatus exclusively spoken to by OilPrice.com. These plans, said one of the sources, will run in parallel with plans for Qatar to also make available to Germany sizeable supplies of LNG from the Golden Pass terminal on the Gulf Coast of Texas, in which QatarEnergy holds a 70 percent stake, with ExxonMobil holding the remainder. However, the sources added, the delivery timelines and volumes under discussion would offer only a partial solution to the gas crunch Europe faces and even this will not occur any time soon. This said, both Germany and France have been busy seeking further alternatives, although how reliable in the energy or political sense of the word they will be remains to be seen. According to local UAE sources , following the visits of Scholz and Germany’s Economy Minister, Robert Habeck, as part of a new Energy Security and Industry Accelerator agreement signed between the UAE and Germany, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) will supply RWE with an LNG cargo in late 2022 to be used in the country’s floating LNG import terminal in Brunsbuttel. ADNOC has also earmarked several other LNG cargoes for German customers for delivery in 2023, the same sources said. France’s TotalEnergies, meanwhile, recently signed a partnership agreement with ADNOC that includes cooperation in trading, product supply and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. As TotalEnergies stated at the time of the signing of the partnership agreement with ADNOC: “[The agreement includes] the development of oil and gas projects in the UAE to ensure sustainable energy supply to the markets and contribute to global energy security.” The final of the three potential setbacks for the EU’s new multi-pronged energy initiative, although itself entirely predictable, given the zero-sum game of energy, economics, and geopolitical dominance currently being played out between the West and the East, is that China will not help Europe out at all. According to several reports last week , China has told its state-owned gas importers to stop reselling LNG to buyers in Europe (and in Asia) as it seeks to ensure its own supply for the winter season. As highlighted for some time by OilPrice.com, China has been busily securing long-term contracts for LNG supplies for months – well before Russia invaded Ukraine – with a key target seller being, of course, Qatar . This remarkably coincidental level of prescience – almost impossible to believe, in fact - means that not only has China tied up much of the gas supplies that Europe has found itself needing but also that it has done so at the rock-bottom gas prices that pre-dated the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The findings, published in the October 20, 2022 issue of Nature Communications , show that the same molecules involved in RA can have opposite functions in cells obtained from different patients -; and help explain why current targeted therapies evoke different responses in patients with the same diagnosis and similar symptoms. Arthritis encompasses more than 100 conditions that affect the joints, tissues around the joint and other connective tissues. It is estimated that more than 58 million adults in the United States (one in five) have been diagnosed with the condition. Osteoarthritis is the most common form, involving degeneration of joints, often in the hands, hips, and knees. RA is less common, but still affects more than two million Americans, primarily women. It is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by long lasting or chronic, painful tissue inflammation in affected joints. It can also cause problems in other organs, such as the lungs, heart, and eyes. The causes and risk factors for RA are myriad and not well understood. They range from age, sex, and lifestyle (such as smoking) to obesity and inherited traits. There is no cure for RA, but there are a broad range of targeted treatments that can help slow disease progression, prevent joint deformity, and reduce pain and disability. Although that RA arises with similar clinical appearance between patients, response to any individual treatment is unpredictable and requires a trial and error method. This process is repeated until a drug that decreases disease activity for that particular patient is identified.\" Gary Firestein, MD, Co-Corresponding Author, Distinguished Professor of Medicine and Director of the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute, UC San Diego School of Medicine \"Many patients have improved outcomes, but a significant percentage do not. They have persistent inflammation. These variable responses to therapy indicate the same disease can have diverse mechanisms.\" That diversity or heterogeneity of disease with varying cell types in individual RA patients has driven efforts to find personalized mechanisms that would help to better understand the nature of RA and reliably prescribe effective, early treatment. In the new study, the UC San Diego team focused on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), a specialized cell type found inside joint synovium -; a soft connective tissue that lubricates joints and minimizes wear-and-tear. FLS play a major role in RA joint destruction. Examining cultured primary FLS, the researchers identified specific transcription factors (proteins that regulate the transcription or copying of genes) that are involved in individual RA patients' cell lines. The analysis allowed scientists to stratify those cell lines into at least two subtypes with different predicted activated pathways that could contribute to inflammation. \"Essentially, we biologically validated these predictions for the top subtype-specific transcription factors,\" said co-corresponding author Wei Wang, PhD, professor in the departments of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. \"This study is the first to characterize groups of cell lines from RA patients with distinctive transcription factor biology by integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic data.\" System biology is a computational approach that studies the interactions and behavior of all components of a biological entity, based on the understanding that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. In taking this approach, the authors wrote, the findings could help pave the way toward a greater understanding of RA's heterogeneity while providing better focus on existing and future therapies personalized to individual patients.

Sunak had told TOI he was \"strongly committed\" to the UK-India FTA to create jobs in both countries and for India to liberalise its consumer financial services industry. The UK-India trade deal stalled under Liz Truss after disparaging remarks by then home secretary Suella Braverman regarding migration from India to the UK. But UK-India relations could soar under Sunak. It did not take long for PM Narendra Modi to tweet: \"Warmest congratulations @RishiSunak! As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues, and implementing Roadmap 2030. Special Diwali wishes to the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership.\" Sunak previously told TOI in an exclusive interview that he was \"strongly committed\" to the UK-India FTA and that the City of London could help facilitate India's growth by helping to get capital to them and also that the UK could facilitate climate finance to fund India's net zero ambitions. He also told TOI he was keen for the FTA to create jobs in both countries and for India to liberalise its consumer financial services industry. \"There is a rapidly growing consumer financial services industry in India, for example in insurance, and where India is opening up markets, financial services companies like HSBC and others, are able to offer products, services to Indian consumers, often in partnership with Indians firms, and that is good, as it broadens choice for Indian citizens.\" he said. Earlier this year too he said the way he reimagined the UK-India relationship was \"a partnership of equals\" where the brightest talent from both countries travel back and forth to study and work, one which includes a close trading partnership on goods and services, and where the UK and India freely exchange world-class ideas and innovation. In a speech at the India Global Forum UK-India awards earlier this year, he said: \"The UK does not have a natural right to sit at the table with one of the world's largest, fastest growing, and most dynamic economies. We must earn it. Right now, there are something like 900 million Indian people under the age of 35. They are smart. They are increasingly well-educated. They are ambitious. And when they look out at the world, we can't take for granted that they will look to the UK.\"\ntoi\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/hope-floats-for-stalled-india-uk-trade-deal/","tags":[],"title":"Hope floats for stalled India-UK trade deal"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"“Has it all and is different from the others” – Gary Lineker chooses ‘exceptional’ Barcelona star as his favorite above Lionel Messi sportskeeda\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/has-it-all-and-is-different-from-the-others-gary-lineker-chooses-/","tags":["Football"],"title":"“Has it all and is different from the others” – Gary Lineker chooses ‘exceptional’ Barcelona star as his favorite above Lionel Messi"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"T20 World Cup 2022 Points Table: Updated standings after South Africa vs Zimbabwe Match 18 sportskeeda\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/t20-world-cup-2022-points-table-updated-standings-after-south-africa-vs-zi/","tags":["Cricket News"],"title":"T20 World Cup 2022 Points Table: Updated standings after South Africa vs Zimbabwe Match 18"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Early Black Friday Samsung TV deals: save up to $3,000 on The Frame, Neo 4K, 8K, OLED TVs Samsung has launched Black Friday savings on its TV line, with discounts of up to $3,000 off Neo QLED 4K and 8K panels, as well as The Frame and OLED sets.Save up to $3,000 on Samsung TVs.Samsung's Black Friday in October sale offers highly aggressive deals on its TV range — making it an excellent time to upgrade your home theater and pair the high-definition models with Apple's new 2022 Apple TV 4K with 128GB of storage (check prices).

When it comes to the NBA, guys like Julius Erving and even Magic Johnson were people who he looked up to. Watching Dr. J take to NBA hardwood in person for the first time was actually what led to O’Neal telling his father that he wanted to be a professional basketball player. However, the two men only taught him about what kind of basketball player he wanted to be. In terms of life lessons, there was only one person in Shaq’s life, his stepfather, Phillip Harrison. Shaq and his stepfather were so close that he never even considered Harrison to be his stepfather, always calling him his father throughout his life. Diesel learned a lot of things from Phillip Harrison. This included responsibility, chivalry, and even kindness. Also Read: Throughout his life, Shaq has had numerous life-changing experiences. Most of them have changed his life for the better and have been brought on through his interactions with his stepfather, Phillip Harrison. In an interview talking about his relationship with his stepfather. The four-time NBA Champion revealed how he learned a valuable lesson of kindness from him. Diesel recalled how he and his stepfather once went for a meal to White Castle. On their way back, Shaq was told to stop the car and he witnessed his stepdad help a hungry homeless man. Harrison gave the man some of the leftovers they had from their trip to White Castle. Leaving O’Neal with a lesson he would never forget. In 1992, O’Neal entered the NBA, and throughout his 19-year career, he accumulated a lot of wealth. Enough to put his parents on a $750,000 salary. A truly grateful gesture on Shaq’s part. It is amazing just how thoughtful and caring a human being the big man is, his stepfather would be proud.

New IRS Instructions for Tax Form 1040 The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released its 2022 draft instructions for tax form 1040 last week. Form 1040 is the tax form used for filing individual income tax returns in the U.S. The new instructions contain several changes relating to cryptocurrency. The section titled “Virtual Currency” has been replaced with one titled “Digital Assets.” The IRS detailed: Digital assets are any digital representations of value that are recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology. For example, digital assets include non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. In contrast, NFTs and stablecoins were not mentioned in the 2021 instructions for tax form 1040. The instructions explain that taxpayers must check the “Yes” box next to the question on digital assets on page 1 of the tax form 1040 if at any time during 2022, they “received (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services)” or “sold, exchanged, gifted, or otherwise disposed of a digital asset (or any financial interest in any digital asset).” The 1040 draft tax form for the year 2022 was released in August. Matt Metras, an enrolled agent and cryptocurrency tax specialist at MDM Financial Services in Rochester, New York, was quoted by CNBC as saying Monday: I think that’s a good change. People who trade things like NFTs would not think of that as a virtual currency. He added that the IRS’ “broader language” may include new categories, such as taxpayers receiving digital assets from “play-to-earn games.” Metras noted: “The IRS is always going to be behind the eight ball because they just can’t keep up with how fast the crypto space is changing.” Miles Fuller, head of government solutions at Taxbit and former senior counsel with the Office of Chief Counsel at the IRS, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying: The IRS is ramping up by coalescing their terminology around this digital asset term. “So it means that it’s more likely than not in the near future, we’re gonna see those regs come out and the IRS continuing to move forward with sort of implementation of a regulatory regime,” he opined. “Probably sooner rather than later.” What do you think about the IRS’ revised crypto-related instructions?

The answers are important when it comes to dealing with antibiotic resistance, which is a serious challenge for the entire healthcare sector.\nDo many Swedes obtain antibiotics without a prescription, and what drives their behaviour when this happens? The answers are important when it comes to dealing with antibiotic resistance, which is a serious challenge for the entire healthcare sector. Practical philosophers and political scientists at the University of Gothenburg have carried out a large study examining Swedes' experiences of - and attitudes towards - obtaining antibiotics without a prescription. The researchers are affiliated with the Centre for Antibiotic Resistance Research (CARe) at the University of Gothenburg, and their study has recently been published in the scientific journal PLOS One. In order to slow down the development of resistant bacteria it is key to limit the use of antibiotics. This is why healthcare services are trying to limit prescriptions for antibiotics, with doctors being encouraged to take a restrictive approach. At the same time, there are many opportunities to get hold of antibiotics without a prescription, such as when traveling abroad, via foreign contacts or from online pharmacies that circumvent national regulations. \"First we conducted a smaller pilot study,\" says Christian Munthe, who led the study in collaboration with Erik Malmqvist and Björn Rönnerstrand. \"Eighteen percent of respondents indicated that they had obtained antibiotics without a prescription and 16 percent would consider doing so, which was highly concerning. Their motivation was often that they were unhappy with or did not trust healthcare.\" The researchers only found a few publications on the subject, most of which dealt with related phenomena or pharmaceuticals in general. However, no study had examined the issue specifically for antibiotics, or why some people circumvent society's rules that are intended to control antibiotic use. We therefore went ahead with a large study using the SOM Institute's Swedish Citizen Panel, with several thousand people who make up a more representative sample of the population as a whole, enabling us to examine the hypothesis that trust in healthcare plays an important role in this phenomenon.\" Christian Munthe, Study's Lead Author One of their main findings was that the proportion of Swedes who have obtained or want to obtain antibiotics without a prescription is lower than the pilot study suggested. At the same time, almost twice as many - just under 5percent of the respondents - would be willing to do so in the future compared to those who reported having done so (2.3percent). The other main finding is that trust in healthcare - or lack of trust - outweighed all other potential explanatory factors, such as level of education and concerns about one's own health. \"Because we know that trust in healthcare varies widely from country to country, our results provide a strong reason for countries with trust rates that are lower than the Nordic countries to review the situation and put measures in place if it turns out that many people are obtaining antibiotics without prescriptions.\" The researchers believe that Sweden also has good reason to monitor this issue in view of how many people are prepared to buy antibiotics without prescriptions in the future. \"It is also important to consider the need to maintain and strengthen trust in healthcare when devising strategies to limit antibiotic use.\" University of Gothenburg Munthe, C., et al.

The study, led by researchers from Columbia University and includes University of Michigan scientists, also found that another 22% have mild cognitive impairment. People with dementia and mild cognitive impairment are more likely to be older, have lower levels of education, and to be racialized as Black or Hispanic. Men and women have similar rates of dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Although dementia and mild cognitive impairment are known to be common in the United States, accurate, up-to-date measures of their national prevalence were scarce. “Because the HCAP study is part of the nationally representative and long-running Health and Retirement Study, these data not only show the burden of dementia now, but will be used in the future to track the trends in dementia burden in the decades ahead,” said study co-author Kenneth Langa, the Cyrus Sturgis Professor in the U-M Medical School, a research professor in the Institute for Social Research, and Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System. “Following those trends will be especially important given the likely impact of COVID and other recent population health changes on the risk for dementia in the coming decades.” The study was published in the journal JAMA Neurology. The study was based on data on 3,500 individuals in the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) Project, part of U-M's nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Between 2016 and 2017, each participant completed a comprehensive set of neuropsychological tests and in-depth interviews, which were used to develop an algorithm for diagnosing dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Rates of dementia and mild cognitive impairment rose sharply with age: 3% of people between 65 and 69 had dementia, rising to 35% for people aged 90 and over. Such data are critical for understanding the causes, costs, and consequences of dementia and mild cognitive impairment in the United States, and for informing policies aimed at reducing their impact on patients, families, and public programs.” Jennifer J. Manly, Study's Lead Author and Professor of Neuropsychology in Neurology at the Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center and the Taub Institute for Research in Aging and Alzheimer's disease at Columbia University “With increasing longevity and the aging of the Baby Boom generation, cognitive impairment is projected to increase significantly over the next few decades, affecting individuals, families, and programs that provide care and services for people with dementia.” The economic impact of dementia, including unpaid family caregiving, is estimated to cost $257 billion per year in the United States and $800 billion worldwide. Unlike previous large studies of dementia in the United States, participants in the new study are representative of older adults, and the researchers could examine differences in the national prevalence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment by age, race and ethnicity, gender and education. The data show a disproportionate burden of dementia among older adults who self-identified as Black or African American, of mild cognitive impairment among older adults who identify as Hispanic, and both categories of cognitive impairment among people who had fewer opportunities to obtain education. David Weir, a research professor at ISR's Survey Research Center, is the principal investigator of the HRS, and co-author of the current study. “Large, diverse and nationally representative population studies are essential to identifying the kinds of disparities shown here,” Weir said. “This study caps over a decade of development of methods to bring robust diagnostic tools out of the clinic and into the population.” Langa is the principal investigator of the HCAP study. Weir and Langa are co-principal investigators of the HCAP International Network. Langa, Weir and collaborators developed the HCAP protocol prior to implementing it in the U.S. in 2016 as part of the HRS. The HRS HCAP project is also part of an international network of studies on dementia using the same study protocol to collect comparable data on dementia in 15 countries around the world. This will allow researchers to gauge and compare the burden of dementia in low-, middle-, and high-income countries now and into the next decade. The other contributors are: Richard N.

Researchers at Tokyo University of Science have previously reported on the oxytocin-induced reversal of impaired synaptic plasticity triggered by amyloid β peptide (25-35) (Aβ 25-35 ). They now show that an oxytocin derivative with modifications to enhance brain perfusion can reverse Aβ 25-35 -induced cognitive impairment in mice. The cognitive decline and memory loss observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is attributed to the accumulation of β-amyloid protein (Aβ), which impairs neural function in the brain. Experimentation has shown that oxytocin, a peptide hormone primarily responsible for parturition, bonding, and lactation, also regulates cognitive behavior in the rodent central nervous system (CNS). This finding, along with the identification of oxytocin receptors in CNS neurons, has spurred interest in the potential role of oxytocin in reversing memory loss tied to cognitive disorders like AD. However, peptides like oxytocin are characterized by weak blood-brain barrier permeability, and so can only by efficiently delivered to the brain via intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration. ICV, however, is an invasive technique which is impractical to implement clinically. Delivering peptides to the CNS via intranasal (IN) administration is a viable clinical option. Prof. Chikamasa Yamashita at Tokyo University of Science recently patented a method to increase the efficiency of peptide delivery to the brain, by introducing cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and a penetration accelerating sequence (PAS) through structural modifications. Previous work had confirmed that both CPPs and the PAS benefit the nose-to-brain delivery pathway. Now, a group of researchers, led by Prof. Akiyoshi Saitoh and Prof. Jun-Ichiro Oka, leveraged this approach to prepare an oxytocin derivative: PAS-CPPs-oxytocin. Their findings were published online in Neuropsychopharmacology Reports on 19 September 2022. We have previously shown that oxytocin reverses amyloid β peptide (25-35) (Aβ 25-35 )-induced impairment of synaptic plasticity in rodents. We wanted to see if PAS-CPPs-oxytocin could be delivered more efficiently to the mouse brain for clinical application, and if it improved cognitive functional behavior in mice.\" Prof. Jun-Ichiro Oka The group first developed an A\u0026β 25-35 peptide-induced amnesia model by supplying Aβ 25-35 to the mouse brain using ICV delivery. During the course of the study, the spatial working and spatial reference memories of these mice were evaluated using the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. After confirming that memory was affected in Aβ 25-35 -impaired mice, PAS-CPPs-oxytocin and native oxytocin were administered using the IN and ICV routes respectively, to see if learning and memory improved in the treated mice. Finally, the distribution of the IN-administered oxytocin derivative in brain tissue was profiled by imaging of a fluorescent-tagged oxytocin derivative. The results of this study were quite promising! The tagged PAS-CPPs-oxytocin showed distribution throughout the mouse brain following its IN administration. While the ICV administration of native oxytocin improved test outcomes in both the Y-maze and MWM tests, the IN administered PAS-CPPs-oxytocin yielded memory improving effects in the Y-maze test. Hailing the team's discovery, Prof. Oka says,\"My team is the first to show that the oxytocin derivative can improve the Aβ 25-35 -induced memory impairment in mice. This suggests that oxytocin may help reduce the cognitive decline we see in Alzheimer's disease.\" Why are these findings clinically useful? Prof. Oka explains the broader implications of their work,\"The oxytocin derivative enters the brain more efficiently. Furthermore, since IN delivery is a non-invasive procedure, this modified version of the hormone could potentially be a clinically viable treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\" Tokyo University of Science Takahashi, J., et al.

The Worm was… The post “I’m The Only Player in NBA History To Build An Image Without Nike or Adidas”: Dennis Rodman Once Boasted About the Sheer Uniqueness of his Eccentricity appeared first on The SportsRush.\nBasketball has seen superstars and cult icons of various types. None of these, however, hold even a candle to the persona and the myth that became . The Worm was one of the most influential basketball players of his time. Both in his pioneering style of defending on the court, and for his wild and often irrational seeming actions off it. Rodman saw considerable criticism at the time for various reasons. However, it is important to note that mental health issues and remedies weren’t particularly in the mainstream during Rodman’s playing years. Everyone saw the maverick, but not what led to Rodman’s maverick nature. Inspecting the same, it becomes very evident that The Worm struggled aplenty with mental health issues. And this realization combined with the narrative surrounding him has led to a bold claim from the former Bulls and Pistons star. Rodman, , stated that he was the only player not to be moulded by brand endorsements. The Worm’s personality and all aspects of it that came along with it, was 100% Rodman and nothing else. In an era where brand endorsements and the money surrounding it dictated a lot, Rodman has a good case for validation of his claim therein. Rodman was one of a kind and played to no rules. Clauses of an endoresement contract would have been the last of The Worm’s concerns during the wild period of his career. The Worm also went on to state that he would only be one of many if he played today. In his own words, An emotional Rodman went on to add that I Eras can indeed define legacies. Since Rodman, there have been many more NBA players who have lived out similarly happening legacies – however, none of them have arguably seen the spotlight as The Worm did. Dennis Rodman was a sort of Draymond Green before Draymond Green. Seeing a defender of Green’s ilk thrive in today’s game despite being a poor shooter, there is reason to believe that Rodman could have done a job today too. Rodman was mostly employed in the forward spot, but was one of the greatest rebounders the game has ever seen. Dennis has also been widely cited as the best defender of his era. These two skills are translatable to any era and would make Rodman a serviceable NBA player at the least. A fierce one-on-one defender who doesn’t ask for many touches in offense is a GM’s dream. One such glue guy needs to feature to make any lineup work. Rodman would have been an ideal glue guy of such requirement today, as he was in his peak. One of those players who never took anything for granted, The Worm guaranteed 100% hustle on the court. Another quality no one can pass on, eras aside. So, yes. Rodman, would have been a glue guy in a contender even in today’s game. With access to better mental health conditioning, he may even have had a less “eventful” NBA career.

The \"Living With Data\" project sought to understand people's perceptions of how data about them is collected, analyzed, shared and used (\"data uses\") in three public sectors: welfare, health and public service media. The research found that people are concerned and often confused about commercial companies accessing, using and profiting from data initially gathered for the social good , such as health data , or by public sector organizations like the NHS. The research shows clarity about commercial involvement in public sector data uses may reduce confusion, but it won't reduce concerns. It was found that people who know most about data uses are, in fact, the most concerned about them. Of particular concern was the involvement of big tech companies like Amazon and Palantir in the NHS COVID-19 Data Store. Only 5% of people support commercial companies profiting from the use of personal data, and only one in ten are not concerned about commercial companies being involved in providing public services like health or welfare. Experts say this finding highlights the urgent need for public sector organizations to review their data-driven systems, especially those from which commercial companies can profit. Professor of Digital Society Helen Kennedy, from the University of Sheffield, said, \"One way to do this is for public sector data practitioners to consider alternative ways of delivering data services. This won't be easy due to the global monopoly on the provision of these services, but it's not impossible. Changes to the data ecosystem could give the public more confidence in the use of their personal data that policymakers and users are keen to see.\" Different demographic groups have differing concerns about what their data is used for, demonstrating that social inequalities also play a role in shaping people's attitudes to data uses. Disabled people were found to be more positive about the sharing of health data than people who did not have a disability, and white people trusted the police's data uses more than Black, Asian and other racially minoritized people. The research also found that older people trusted their GP more than younger people , and LGBTQ+ people trust health organizations less than heterosexual cisgender respondents. However, despite these differences, there were also similarities. The research found that people from different groups were aware that data uses can reinforce inequalities, and they don't want data uses to have negative consequences for people from disadvantaged or minority communities . For example, there is concern that people who don't have access to the relevant technology in their homes are excluded from using data-driven systems. They want data-driven systems to be inclusive \"for all communities,\" as one participant in the research commented. Professor Kennedy added, \"Data policymakers and data practitioners need to acknowledge that there is widespread concern about the potentially discriminatory impacts of different data-driven systems. Then they need to address this problem. The way society uses data needs to change so it can eliminate harms and its use is in the public or social interest. Sometimes, in order to do these things, specific data uses need to stop, such as those that deepen inequalities. Regardless of how well data uses are currently communicated, the public will continue to be concerned if these changes are not made.\" The report recommends that eliminating harms on people from disadvantaged and minority groups and ensuring data uses are in the public or social interest should drive change.

That would be on top of the largest-ever release of 180 million barrels, approved earlier this year as a tool for bringing down retail fuel prices. Back then, experts warned this tool could hurt its wielder. Now, the danger seems to be even greater. “We remain very able, very vigilant: if we need to deal with additional challenges with supply, with affordability, we’ll have additional opportunity with the SPR if we need to do more sales into the future beyond that December time period,” one senior administration official told the Financial Times this week. This makes further sales from the SPR virtually a certainty: analysts expect prices to rise in December after the European Union embargo on Russian crude comes into effect, which will happen on the 5 th of the month. With OPEC+ reducing output by about a million barrels daily from November, this means that the supply of crude globally will tighten in the coming months. And when supply tightens, prices rise. Many see Biden’s latest move as a way of earning credit for the Democrat government ahead of the midterm elections. Biden himself says there is no political motive behind the SPR release strategy. And Goldman Sachs analysts just said this week that SPR releases would have only a modest effect on prices. In a note last week, they wrote that they expected the White House to release another 16 million barrels in 2023 “from FY2023 Congressionally mandated sales” but that those sales, first, would depend on oil prices and, second, would only have a limited impact on prices of less than $5 per barrel. The biggest problem with using the SPR as a way of regulating oil prices is that, being a strategic reserve, it would be dangerous to draw too much from it. Another 16 million barrels on top of the 180 million approved for release this year should not make a major difference in inventory levels, but observers are already getting nervous about those levels. At a little over 400 million barrels, the current amount of oil in the SPR is not enough for a month of consumption in case of emergency. One might point out that the U.S. cannot consume only locally produced oil for any length of time, which makes the SPR redundant, but it could certainly trade it for other blends should such a need arise. It seems not everyone is really buying the assurance that there is no political motive for the new release plans. Indeed, as early as the original reserve release plan, many commentators in the media argued that with it, Biden wanted to try and make sure the Democrats win the midterms or at least do not lose them very badly because of high retail fuel prices. “After the Opec meeting and with the midterms in mind, the administration needed to be seen doing something — and that seems to be announcing more SPR barrels that were already planned,” Energy Aspects’ Amrita Sen told the FT this week. What this means is that the administration is, for all its talk of all tools on the table, severely short of actual tools. There must be awareness in the White House that the SPR is a double-edged sword, and wielding it is quite risky. Yet they are wielding it for lack of a better option. There is only one other tool on that White House table that is even riskier: an export ban. The idea has only been mentioned in a general way, with assurances that nobody is seriously considering it, although some legislators have called for precisely that: ban exports, and keep prices low for Americans. Critics have pointed out that the likelihood of success from the use of that tool is rather low, with Goldman analysts warning earlier this month that a ban on exports could push both oil and fuel prices sky-high and still create shortages at home. It is, then, a question of choosing the lesser evil. And the lesser evil appears to be releasing additional barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve “responsibly where it makes sense to stabilize markets,” per Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk, as reported by Reuters. So, while OPEC tightens supply, the U.S. will stand ready to continue boosting it from its strategic reserve. And it will have to be careful not to deplete this reserve too much because the more oil released now, the more oil will need to be purchased later to replenish the reserve. It is perhaps not the most elegant way of solving the gasoline price conundrum that has made life harder for the Biden administration this year. But it appears to be the only realistic way of trying to solve it. The alternative is even more unpalatable.

This breakthrough has been led by Professor Sung Ho Park and his research team in the Department of Biological Sciences at UNIST, in collaboration with a research team, led by Professor Goo Taeg Oh from Ewha Womans University. Microglia, the primary immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), are known to eliminate unwanted germs and debris and remove dying neurons. In this study, the research team classified a new type of microglia with enhanced antioxidant function and markers similar to those of disease-associated microglia (DAM), designated them as stroke-associated microglia (SAM). Through animal experiments, the research team demonstrated that the presence of the typical antioxidant gene, Peroxiredoxin-1 (Prdx1), protects against acute I/R injury and is required for SAM activation and the consequent reduction of microglial cell death and inflammatory responses. In addition, after performing transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) surgery to induce ischemic stroke in mice, the research team found that Prdx1−/− mice were more severely injured by acute I/R injury, as confirmed by TTC staining, neurological deficit scores, motor tests, and the survival rate, indicating that Prdx1 has a protective function. In this study, we have, for the first time, identified a specialized and distinctive type of microglia with enhanced antioxidant function in stroke mice. Prdx1-dependent SAM may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for protecting microglial function and treating brain I/R injury,\" He adds, \"Although this new cluster will require further study, our findings provide a new perspective that Prdx1-mediated microglial heterogeneity is important in ischemic stroke.\" Professor Sung Ho Park, UNIST This study has been jointly participated by Wonhyo Lee, a doctoral researcher within the Department of Biological Sciences at UNIST and Sinai Kim, a doctoral researcher within the Department of Life Sciences at Ewha Womans University, as first authors.

Nearly three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds are full, according to national data compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services. Some areas are seeing pediatric hospitals full, including the Washington, DC , and Boston areas. Multiple viruses are behind the surge. As Ars reported earlier, health officials have warned about a surge in adenoviruses and enteroviruses , both common childhood respiratory viruses. One enterovirus, called EV-D68, is associated with a polio-like neurologic condition called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in young children, and health officials are bracing for a subsequent uptick in AFM cases. So far, the CDC has not seen such a rise this fall. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does, however, indicate a skyrocketing rate of cases of RSV— respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus . RSV is a common respiratory infection that produces cold-like symptoms in most people but can turn life-threatening in a small percentage of cases, particularly those in infants and young children with specific underlying health conditions. RSV typically rises later in the winter, with peaks in recent pre-pandemic years during late December. But, circulation of the virus began rising in late summer this year, and cases are now high, with the latest weekly case count from October 15 at over 7,000 , according to CDC data . The peak of RSV cases in 2021 saw weekly counts mostly around 4,000. Advertisement Enlarge / Flu-like activity is off to an early start with this year's data marked on the left with red triangles. CDC FluView And RSV isn't the only virus getting an early start this fall. Flu circulation is also off to an unusually strong start, and officials worry that it could also be a particularly bad flu season. The brisk rise of cold-weather viruses has experts doubling down on calls for flu shots and COVID-19 boosters. Although reported cases of COVID-19 are not showing signs of a dramatic upswing, the use of at-home testing makes official case counts difficult to interpret, and experts anticipate that a winter wave of COVID-19 is on the horizon, if not already starting. \"I think now's a prudent time to not just get the COVID booster, the new bivalent vaccine, but also the flu vaccine,\" former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a Sunday interview on CBS News' Face the Nation . \"Right now, we have flu cases picking up. It looks like this may be a more aggressive flu season. The predominant strain right now is H3N2, and the vaccine appears to be a good match for the strain.\" As such, the vaccine looks like it will be \"quite protective,\" he said, and now is \"a good time to get it.\" As for why this fall and winter are shaping up to be so rough, experts speculate it's a combination of pandemic-related disruptions. The global explosion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, subsequent lockdowns, and pandemic mitigation efforts wrecked normal transmission cycles of garden-variety respiratory viruses. Additionally, the reprieve from common viruses has created a larger-than-normal pool of susceptible young children as well as adults with waning immunity from past exposures.\narstechnica\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/childrens-hospitals-fill-up-amid-up-early-surge-in-respiratory-infection/","tags":["Science","adenovirus","AFM","CDC","Children's Hospital","COVID-19","enterovirus","flu","flu season","Infectious disease","pediatric","Respiratory illnesses","respiratory infections","RSV"],"title":"Children’s hospitals fill up amid up early surge in respiratory infections"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"“Humble guy who wants to learn and improve” – Graham Potter names Chelsea star who has ‘impressed’ him on and off the pitch sportskeeda\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/humble-guy-who-wants-to-learn-and-improve-graham-potter-names-che/","tags":["Football"],"title":"“Humble guy who wants to learn and improve” – Graham Potter names Chelsea star who has ‘impressed’ him on and off the pitch"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"“I think it’s more a team thing” – Graham Potter offers interesting opinion on concern about Raheem Sterling’s form at Chelsea sportskeeda\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/i-think-its-more-a-team-thing-graham-potter-offers-interesting/","tags":["Football"],"title":"“I think it’s more a team thing” – Graham Potter offers interesting opinion on concern about Raheem Sterling’s form at Chelsea"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"More intensive prostate cancer screening may reduce the risk of metastatic cancer later In the face of conflicting evidence over the risks and benefits of routine prostate cancer screenings, a large, longitudinal analysis found Veterans Health Administration medical centers with lower prostate screening rates had higher rates of metastatic prostate cancer cases in subsequent years than centers with higher screening rates.\nnews-medical\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/more-intensive-prostate-cancer-screening-may-reduce-the-risk-of-metastatic-/","tags":[],"title":"More intensive prostate cancer screening may reduce the risk of metastatic cancer later"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"Systematic review uncovers new links between the thyroid and the heart Systematic review of 32 studies with 1.3 million participants uncovers new connections between the thyroid and the heart.\nnews-medical\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/systematic-review-uncovers-new-links-between-the-thyroid-and-the-heart/","tags":[],"title":"Systematic review uncovers new links between the thyroid and the heart"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"All The Harry Potter Movies Return To HBO Max, Bringing 10 Star Trek Movies With Streaming services and licenses are weird, and that means that the Harry Potter series, despite being Warner Bros. productions, sometimes leave HBO Max, a Warner Bros.

Sometimes, I genuinely wonder if the British electorate has a humiliation kink. Maybe it’s because I’m not invested in conservative ideology or feel opposed to many of their core values, but when I come across people who remain ardent Tories, nothing else makes sense to me. Sometimes, I genuinely wonder if the British electorate has a humiliation kink. But perhaps one of the most head-scratching moments of this whole ordeal was how Boris Johnson’s supporters were pushing for him to make a comeback following Liz Truss’ disastrous 44 days as prime minister. After a short-lived campaign, Johnson ruled out the possibility Sunday. But that there was even a chance that he could be a candidate after he resigned in disgrace following his mishandling of a sexual misconduct issue within his party speaks volumes. But before I go into that, let me catch you up quickly on the level of embarrassment we’ve been experiencing in the U.K. During Truss’ short premiership, she lost two crucial members of her Cabinet (she fired her finance minister and her home secretary resigned). She also tanked the economy, U-turned on a number of her plans like tax cuts and then looked on as her new finance minister reversed the majority of her policies mere days after she vehemently defended them. Things got so bad that the tabloid newspaper The Daily Star created a YouTube livestream where a head of unrefrigerated lettuce was placed next to a photo of Truss to see which one would survive the longest. Many of us thought Truss’ catastrophic time as leader was inevitable, given that before she became prime minister, she was most famous for her rant about cheese. Another thing that felt just as inevitable was that, as the government once again fell to pieces, it was being cobbled back together without a general election. Instead, Sunak was put into power exclusively by Conservative members of Parliament. Because his most probable opponent, Penny Mordaunt, dropped out at the eleventh hour, he was the only candidate left standing. He won by default without the vote being decided online by all Conservative Party members, as planned. Of course, limiting the decision of a new prime minister to the members of one party alone is undemocratic, but the fact that Sunak was elected by a select number of MPs (who arguably had their own agendas) and not a single member of the general public is borderline dictatorial. Four of our last five prime ministers have been chosen without a general election. While it is still feasible for one to be called, U.K. law means it is pretty much at the prime minister’s discretion whether a general election happens before January 2025 — when the next one is due to take place. Of course, limiting the decision of a new prime minister to the members of one party alone is undemocratic. But as predictable as this chain of events was, one thing that I genuinely didn’t expect was the media, members of Parliament and the public touting Johnson to become prime minister again. From tweets by MPs to more lengthy endorsements — with one since-deleted pro-Johnson article by MP Nadhim Zahawi being published minutes after news broke that Johnson wouldn’t move forward with his leadership campaign after all — the support he received was striking. Now, all these public figures have had to make an embarrassing U-turn. Even worse than Johnson receiving MP endorsements — he claimed that he had reached the all-important benchmark of the 100 backers needed to make his leadership bid official — was the fact that people outside the Westminster bubble seemed willing to give him another chance. A recent petition, for example, called “Bring Back Boris” surpassed 25,000 signatures before it was shut down. At the same time, recent data by YouGov also showed that the majority of Conservatives (who, again, were the ones meant to vote for our future prime minister) wanted to see Johnson return as leader. Local media also showed people crying out for Johnson to return. The most concerning thing was that some news outlets acted like Johnson’s becoming prime minister again was a credible way forward after everything he had done. A number of the right-wing tabloids, for instance, treated Johnson’s potential as some kind of “soft launch” or heroic last chance saloon. The Daily Express talked about Boris “bouncing back,” while The Sun teased that Johnson was “eyeing the mother of all comebacks.” The most concerning thing was that some news outlets acted like Johnson’s becoming prime minister again was a credible way forward after everything he had done. It goes back to what I said earlier about the humiliation kink. Why else do so many people keep going back to someone with such blatant contempt for them? It really doesn’t make sense. He unlawfully prorogued or cut short Parliament’s time to discuss his Brexit bill in 2019; ignored scientists’ advice about Covid-19 lockdown procedures; continually flouted the very lockdown rules he instilled, having boozy parties while people attended Zoom funerals for their grandmas. That just scratches the surface of the damage he did as prime minister. The economic prosperity he promised on the side of a bus was replaced with what is now being dubbed a “cost of living crisis,” with energy bills and inflation reaching record highs and the likelihood of energy blackouts this winter. There’s no doubt that, in the short time she was in charge, Truss made things a lot worse, but the problems we’re facing as a country have been present longer than her 44 days in office. Her consecutive blunders didn’t come out of the blue. They were a direct result of the gaping hole Johnson dug in his three-year premiership. The possibility that he could’ve been given another chance — especially so soon after his disgraceful departure — is alarming. As the country shifts its focus to Sunak, it may soon be easy to forget that Conservative members of Parliament and the public really thought it would be good for the country to have Johnson back. But we should not forget. To move on as a country, we have to stop repeating the same mistakes. That means the public must continue to push for general elections so that the power of who gets to lead us is always in the hands of the people.

Against the dollar, the pound remained steady at $1.1303. Relief among investors was clear as gilt yields fell sharply. UK bonds posted some of their biggest gains on record as investors bet incoming PM Rishi Sunak will turn the page on weeks of turmoil dogging the nation's markets and restore credibility to economic policymaking. Short-dated notes led the rally with the two-year yield falling by the most since 1993 after Sunak - a former chancellor who had issued a warning over Liz Truss ' \"fairy tale\" tax cuts - emerged as the winner in the race to succeed her. The gains were supercharged as traders pared bets on future rate hikes. The pound rose too, before falling 0.4% to $1.13 as of 5.42pm in London. It's languishing well below the peaks reached during the first leadership contest over the summer, weighed down by huge economic headwinds ahead (the outlook for the UK's credit score was revised to negative by Moody's Investors Service on Friday). Britain's main equity indexes closed higher on Monday after Sunak looked set to become the next PM following other candidates exiting the race. The blue-chip FTSE 100 gained 0.6%, while the domestically focused FTSE 250 index jumped 0.8%. Truss resigned last Thursday following a market meltdown that pushed yields to their highest in years, forced the central bank to step in to stabilise markets and eventually prompted her to backtrack on plans for a vast fiscal stimulus. Investors expect Sunak will draw a line under the economic damage. \"For now, it's relief that 'total chaos' is over,\" said Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services. \"His credit with markets comes from having been a steady hand as chancellor and being a polished communicator who is not going to 'go off piste' like the Truss government.\" For his part, Sunak was quick to issue a warning on Monday that the UK faces a \"profound economic challenge\". The two-year gilt yield dropped 37 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) on Monday to end at 3.43%. Longer notes also rallied hard, sending the 10-year yield to 3.75%, the lowest since the day former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng first announced his so-called mini budget. Attention is already turning to next week - the next Bank of England meeting. While a 75bps hike is still fully priced, expectations of a bigger increase have faded now.\ntoi\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/uk-bonds-see-record-gain-with-sunak-as-pm/","tags":[],"title":"UK bonds see record gain with Sunak as PM"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"“Sorry I Won the Fight” – Sean O’Malley Apologizes for Victory Over Petr Yan at UFC 280 Sean O’Malley posts pic on social media apologizing for win over Petr Yan at UFC 280.

Despite the ringside decision, many outlets scored the match in Yan’s favor and the audience was not happy. While this is a massive victory for O’Malley Anne might help him move quickly up the ranks, the fan sentiment is certainly against him. In light of this fact, O’Malley put out a pic on social media to apologize for his victory. O’Malley looks sad and has his headphones on in the picture captioned: In a recent interview with barstool sports Devon white said that the fight against Jan was O’Malley’s McGregor versus Jose Aldo moment. What white meant was that a win against Yan would propel O’Malley to the top of his division just like McGregor when he knocked out although in 13 seconds add UFC 194. However, the controversial nature of the win now stands in the way of O’Malley’s future fights. McGregor had a clear victory that shot him to stardom in a spectacular fashion. The same cannot be said about O’Malley’s UFC 280 win. Further, many UFC fans and fight critics would still argue that Yan deserves a title shot against Jermaine sterling. Before his loss to O’Malley, Yan only had one loss to Sterling with the other one being ruled a no contest because of an illegal knee.

An absolute force of nature, Dwight steamrolled his way to superstardom. Drafted one year after LeBron James, it was rare to see two greats go back to back as Pick 1s, but 2003-04 was truly a great time for basketball. He was so great, even his greatest hater, , had to admit he was “nice”. According to him, he was athletic but could see some chinks in his armor. All he had to do was average 28 and 15 -said Shaq on a podcast, but the veteran center called Diesel a hater and ignored the advice. Nobody knows the value of hard work more than Shaq. He did not care about putting in the extra effort to get better, and his ceiling was raised for him. One of the most dominant big men in the game fell short of his expectations, and he rues every moment he did not make the extra push. To see Shaq giving Dwight the plaudits is extraordinary. A vociferous hater of the ex-Orlando center, Shaq said he was nice, which is the highest compliment he could have received. If only the defensive monster listened to his predecessor, Superman could have had a great successor. Dwight Howard was a certified monster. In the era of LeBron James, he led the Orlando Magic to an NBA final. The three-time defensive player of the year should have had more success, but he fell off a cliff once success got to his head. He tried to move to a big market team but suffered miserably. Once he made the move to the Lakers, everything went downhill. His attitude was exposed, he started getting injured quite often, and the game moved away from the post. Players like Brook Lopez overtook him in the skill department, and there was no turning back. The adage “You cannot teach an old dog new tricks” holds in the case of Dwight. He was out-skilled by his juniors, and it just kept going downhill. His acceptance to take a bench role in 2019 finally got him a championship ring, but that’s not how he should have gone. Dwight is currently without a team, and it looks like he’s about to end his career that way.\nthesportsrush\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/dwight-howard-was-better-and-more-athletic-than-me-shaquille-onea/","tags":["Basketball","Dwight Howard","Los Angeles Lakers","Orlando Magic","Shaquille O'Neal"],"title":"“Dwight Howard Was Better and More Athletic Than Me”: Shaquille O’Neal Expresses Disappointment Over Ex-Laker’s Dismissal of His Advice"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Americans See Another 10-Cent Drop In Gasoline Prices Prices at the gas pump have declined 10 cents in a week, according to AAA, which says recession fears and further releases of America’s strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) have contributed to the further declines.

The prices are less than one cent higher than they were a month ago, when the average was $3.700 per gallon, but still off the year-ago average of $3.385. “Global recession fears coupled with the Biden Administration’s plan to continue tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve into December has helped temper oil prices,” said Andrew Gross , AAA spokesperson. “This will help take the pressure off pump prices, benefitting drivers and their wallets.” The biggest drops in gasoline prices took place in Alaska, which saw a 33 cent fall in prices at the pump, followed by Calfironia (down 30 cents), Oregon (down 26 cents), Washington (down 24 cents, Nevada (down 20 cents) and Indiana and Michigan both down 15 cents. Gasoline is now cheapest in the states of Georgia and Texas, where consumers are paying an average of $3.20 per gallon. California remains the most expensive gasoline state, due to state taxes, with prices at the pump averaging $5.75 per gallon despite recent declines. The price of gasoline is a crucial factor in November 4 midterm elections. AAA notes that domestic gasoline demand is around 1 million barrels lower than at the same time last year, noting that better gas mileage could also be limiting demand and helping prices move downwards. \"If demand remains low and oil prices don't spike, pump prices will likely keep falling,\" the club stated.

This is a fairly standard approach to delivered/read in messaging apps from Signal to Telegram. iMessage just uses text, and that is the better approach in our opinion. Checkmarks are ubiquitous and might be more familiar to people, but being able to just read out “Delivered” and “Read” requires less translation, no matter how obvious the icons are. Fortunately, this looks to just be a test that at least three people have received. It’s not rolled out on devices we checked this afternoon, and hopefully Google’s testing will vindicate the current/old Messages approach to delivered and read.

Published today in JAMA Network Open , this study analyzed data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, which is supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and other entities of the National Institutes of Health. This study adds to our growing understanding of the associations between playing video games and brain development. Numerous studies have linked video gaming to behavior and mental health problems. This study suggests that there may also be cognitive benefits associated with this popular pastime, which are worthy of further investigation.\" Nora Volkow, M.D., NIDA Director Although a number of studies have investigated the relationship between video gaming and cognitive behavior, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the associations are not well understood. Only a handful of neuroimaging studies have addressed this topic, and the sample sizes for those studies have been small, with fewer than 80 participants. To address this research gap, scientists at the University of Vermont, Burlington, analyzed data obtained when children entered the ABCD Study at ages 9 and 10 years old. The research team examined survey, cognitive, and brain imaging data from nearly 2,000 participants from within the bigger study cohort. They separated these children into two groups, those who reported playing no video games at all and those who reported playing video games for three hours per day or more. This threshold was selected as it exceeds the American Academy of Pediatrics screen time guidelines, which recommend that videogaming time be limited to one to two hours per day for older children. For each group, the investigators evaluated the children's performance on two tasks that reflected their ability to control impulsive behavior and to memorize information, as well as the children's brain activity while performing the tasks. The researchers found that the children who reported playing video games for three or more hours per day were faster and more accurate on both cognitive tasks than those who never played. They also observed that the differences in cognitive function observed between the two groups was accompanied by differences in brain activity. Functional MRI brain imaging analyses found that children who played video games for three or more hours per day showed higher brain activity in regions of the brain associated with attention and memory than did those who never played. At the same time, those children who played at least three hours of video games per day showed more brain activity in frontal brain regions that are associated with more cognitively demanding tasks and less brain activity in brain regions related to vision. The researchers think these patterns may stem from practicing tasks related to impulse control and memory while playing videogames, which can be cognitively demanding, and that these changes may lead to improved performance on related tasks. Furthermore, the comparatively low activity in visual areas among children who reported playing video games may reflect that this area of the brain may become more efficient at visual processing as a result of repeated practice through video games. While prior studies have reported associations between video gaming and increases in depression, violence, and aggressive behavior, this study did not find that to be the case. Though children who reported playing video games for three or more hours per day did tend to report higher mental health and behavioral issues compared to children who played no video games, the researchers found that this association was not statistically significant, meaning that the authors could not rule out whether this trend reflected a true association or chance. They note that this will be an important measure to continue to track and understand as the children mature. Further, the researchers stress that this cross-sectional study does not allow for cause-and-effect analyses, and that it could be that children who are good at these types of cognitive tasks may choose to play video games. The authors also emphasize that their findings do not mean that children should spend unlimited time on their computers, mobile phones, or TVs, and that the outcomes likely depend largely on the specific activities children engage in. For instance, they hypothesize that the specific genre of video games, such as action-adventure, puzzle solving, sports, or shooting games, may have different effects for neurocognitive development, and this level of specificity on the type of video game played was not assessed by the study. \"While we cannot say whether playing video games regularly caused superior neurocognitive performance, it is an encouraging finding, and one that we must continue to investigate in these children as they transition into adolescence and young adulthood,\" said Bader Chaarani, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont and the lead author on the study. \"Many parents today are concerned about the effects of video games on their children's health and development, and as these games continue to proliferate among young people, it is crucial that we better understand both the positive and negative impact that such games may have.\" Through the ABCD Study, researchers will be able to conduct similar analyses for the same children over time into early adulthood, to see if changes in video gaming behavior are linked to changes in cognitive skills, brain activity, behavior, and mental health. The longitudinal study design and comprehensive data set will also enable them to better account for various other factors in the children's families and environment that may influence their cognitive and behavioral development, such as exercise, sleep quality, and other influences. The ABCD Study, the largest of its kind in the United States, is tracking nearly 12,000 youth as they grow into young adults. Investigators regularly measure participants' brain structure and activity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and collect psychological, environmental, and cognitive information, as well as biological samples. The goal of the study is to understand the factors that influence brain, cognitive, and social-emotional development, to inform the development of interventions to enhance a young person's life trajectory.

That means you'll be able to log into your PayPal account without having to type in your credentials, which in turn makes its quicker to check out your online shopping carts. PayPal says the option will first be available to users with iPhones, iPads and those visiting its website on Macs, but it will expand to additional platforms as they add support for the technology. Google released initial passkey support for Android and Chrome earlier this month and will launch the stable version, as well as an API for native Android apps, later this year. PayPal will also make passkeys available in other countries starting in early 2023.Passkeys use your biometrics to log into your accounts, but it's different from using your face or or fingerprints to auto-populate username and password boxes. With passkeys, you become the login. When you activate the option for an app, it creates a cryptographic key pair associated with your account. One of those keys is public, and that's what apps and services save to confirm your identity. The other key is private and is only stored on your devices, so hackers can't steal them if they ever get into the servers of apps you use. Apps and websites that support passkey then match the public key they have with your private key to make sure that it's you who's logging in. You can switch the feature on by logging into your account with a browser on desktop or mobile — the old way, with your user ID and password — and then choosing \"Create a passkey.\" After you authenticate using Apple Face ID or Touch ID, your passkey will be automatically generated. And since passkeys are synced with iCloud Keychain, you only need to do that once. If you're logging into your account on another device that doesn't have passkey yet, you'll have the option to generate a QR code after entering your user ID. You can then scan that QR code with an iPhone that does support passkey to be able to log in.\nengadget\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/paypal-adds-passkey-support-in-the-us-for-easier-logins-and-check-outs/","tags":["Information Technology","Technology \u0026 Electronics","site|engadget","provider_name|Engadget","region|US","language|en-US","author_name|Mariella Moon"],"title":"PayPal adds passkey support in the US for easier logins and check outs"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Dhanashree Verma shares adorable Diwali post with husband Yuzvendra Chahal from Australia - check HERE Dhanashree recently travelled to Australia to support her husband and Team India for the ongoing mega event of cricket\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/dhanashree-verma-shares-adorable-diwali-post-with-husband-yuzvendra-chahal-/","tags":[],"title":"Dhanashree Verma shares adorable Diwali post with husband Yuzvendra Chahal from Australia - check HERE"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Oil Tanker Market In Disarray As EU Ban On Russian Crude Nears Six weeks before the EU embargo on Russian crude oil exports and the planned price cap on Russian oil enters into force, the global tanker and oil markets face increased uncertainty over who will ship Russia’s oil—and how—as of December 5.

Diwali supposedly marks the triumph of “light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance.” It is also associated with wealth and prosperity. In February 2020, Sunak took his oath of office as chancellor of the exchequer holding a copy of the Bhagavad Gita and celebrated Diwali by putting lights outside his official residence at Number 11 Downing Street. He will now be the first Hindu to become UK prime minister. His time in office will hinge on his ability to deliver a reasonable measure of prosperity to a country that is in dire economic straits.Continue Reading.

Indian- origin Sunak has the support of 142 members of the parliament, exceeding the 100-mark required to bag the top job at 10, Downing Street. Sunak was declared the next leader of Britain's Conservative Party by the chief of the 1922 Committee of Conservative lawmakers on Monday. This placed him on the course to be the country's next prime minister. The committee is tasked with selecting and changing the Conservative party's leader. \"I want to fix our economy, unite our party and deliver for our country,\" former chancellor Rishi Sunak said in a short statement. At age 42, he will be the youngest and the first non- white person to hold the post. The other candidate, former PM Boris Johnson, who entered the race again last week after cutting short a Caribbean holiday, ended his bid for the post yesterday in a surprise decision. He stated his inability to to lead \"a united party in parliament\". Rishi Sunak is the third Prime Minister UK had in seven months. Liz Truss, who had earlier pipped him to the post in the party's internal election and succeeded Boris Johnson, quit after only 45 days in office, on October 20. Sunak, as the next Prime Minister of UK, is tasked to steer the economically floundering nation days after his predecessor Liz Truss stepped down. This is Sunak's second shot at being the Prime Minister. The former U.K. Treasury chief was runner-up to Liz Truss in the contest to replace the scandal-plagued Boris Johnson as Conservative Party leader and prime minister. But Truss had no choice but to quit after a turbulent 45-day term, and Johnson abandoned a comeback attempt at the last minute, leaving Sunak a strong favourite to finally assume the office he narrowly missed out on less than two months ago. If he wins, Rishi Sunak will be Britain's first non-white leader and the first person of the Hindu religion to assume the job of the Prime Minister of the UK. At the age of 42, he will also be the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. Sunak is regarded as a political prodigy whose youthful looks, sharp suits, smooth and confident manner led to him being dubbed \"Dishy Rishi\" by the British media.Also read: Saudi - India Undersea Cables May Soon be a RealityAlso watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/indian-origin-rishi-sunak-set-to-take-the-top-job-of-uks-pm/","tags":["Breaking News,International News,Top Headlines,More,Feature,News Ticker"],"title":"Indian- Origin Rishi Sunak Set to Take the Top Job of UK's PM"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"नासिर हुसैन के नाम से नापाक हरकत कर रहा था पाकिस्तान, पूर्व इंग्लिश कप्तान ने लगा दी लंका Nasser Hussain India vs Pakistan: भारत के खिलाफ मुकाबला हारने के बाद पाकिस्तान अंपायर जिम्मेदार बता रहा है। इसके लिए पाकिस्तानी इंग्लैंड के पूर्व कप्तान के नाम का भी इस्तेमाल कर रहे। लेकिन पूर्व इंग्लिश कप्तान नासिर हुसैन के एक ट्वीट ने सभी की लंका लगा दी है।\nnavbharattimes\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/nasser-hussain-clarifies-as-his-fake-quote-goes-viral/","tags":[],"title":"नासिर हुसैन के नाम से नापाक हरकत कर रहा था पाकिस्तान, पूर्व इंग्लिश कप्तान ने लगा दी लंका"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Rishi Sunak Tells UK Tories To Unite As He Strives To Fix ‘Crisis’ Rishi Sunak called on his warring Conservative Party to unite as the UK’s incoming prime minister bids to fix the crisis facing the economy.\n(Bloomberg) -- Rishi Sunak called on his warring Conservative Party to unite as the UK’s incoming prime minister bids to fix the crisis facing the economy. (Bloomberg) -- Rishi Sunak called on his warring Conservative Party to unite as the UK’s incoming prime minister bids to fix the crisis facing the economy. Speaking less than an hour after emerging victorious in the race to succeed Liz Truss as premier, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer said his party needs to come together after ousting two prime ministers this year, according to a lawmaker present at Sunak’s address to MPs behind closed doors on Monday. Sunak spoke shortly after his last remaining rival, Penny Mordaunt, pulled out of the race for 10 Downing Street, urging her party to “unite and work together for the good of the nation.” That meant there was no need for a runoff vote among grassroots party members. It is a remarkable turnaround in Sunak’s political fortunes, after the former Chancellor of the Exchequer quit Boris Johnson’s government in July and then lost out to Truss in the last Tory leadership contest over the summer. But his repeated warnings that her plans would trigger economic chaos proved correct and put him in pole position when Truss’s premiership imploded. Johnson’s Shadow Even so, Sunak was no shoo-in given the bitterness and division in the Conservative Party. He’s still tarnished in the eyes of many Tory MPs for his role in Johnson’s downfall, and the former prime minister’s flirtation over the weekend with what would have been an outrageous comeback just months after being ousted briefly threatened to derail Sunak’s hopes. In the end, Johnson withdrew without ever showing he had the support of 100 Tory MPs needed to formally contest the leadership. Likewise, Mordaunt pulled out shortly before influential Tory MP Graham Brady was due to announce which candidates had surpassed that threshold. It effectively meant a coronation for Sunak, 42, who becomes the UK’s first Hindu prime minister and the country’s youngest in more than 200 years. Grassroots Tory members, who had the final say when Truss beat out Sunak last time, will have no input this time around. But Sunak now faces a daunting task to try to bring that unity to a party that has been through months of upheaval and is still tearing itself apart over fundamental issues including Brexit and the economy. Some Tory MPs even say the party no longer has a mandate to govern, after a second change of leader since Johnson won the general election in 2019. “It will now be impossible to avoid a GE,” former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said on Twitter. Tory ‘Psychodrama’ On Monday, there were signs that Tory MPs are prepared to rally behind their new leader. After Sunak’s address, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith -- a Brexiteer on the ideological right of the party -- told reporters: “It’s time to end this psychodrama.” And Alex Chalk, a Remainer from the party’s moderate One Nation faction hailed Sunak’s “incredible speech.” “We’ve got to move forward,” Chalk said. “He said it with an articulacy and a power that brought the room to life.” Truss’s decision to step down followed weeks of turmoil as investors jettisoned UK assets. Her economic plan, including borrowing to pay for massive tax cuts, rattled markets and turned voters further against the Tories in record numbers. A Long To-Do List for the UK’s Next Leader: Balance of Power After firing her first finance minister and long-time political ally, Kwasi Kwarteng, Truss brought in Jeremy Hunt -- who backed Sunak on Sunday -- to try to restore calm. Hunt managed that to a degree, but also put the government on course to impose another punishing round of austerity at a politically sensitive time as Britons struggle with soaring living costs. In a column for the Telegraph newspaper late Sunday, Hunt indicated that he and Sunak are aligned on how to tackle the economy. Sunak will “turn the page on what went wrong, take decisions in the national interest and rebuild the extraordinary potential of our economy,” Hunt said. Hunt is due to deliver a major statement on the Treasury’s tax-and-spending plans on Oct. 31, a date picked to better inform the Bank of England on how quickly it should raise interest rates. UK bonds surged at Monday’s open on expectations of a Sunak premiership.

Spending thousands on a GPU, only for it to be an empty box, save for a couple of useless weights.\nThat’s the situation a Newegg customer has apparently found themselves in after sharing an image of an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 box that should contain one of the world’s best graphics cards but instead contains some lumps of metal. Thankfully, in the replies to their Reddit post, it looks like the unlucky customer was able to get their money back – and we hope they can get their hands on an actual RTX 4090 soon – but their tale reminds us that we always need to be careful when buying online. And that advice becomes especially important as we enter November and Black Friday approaches.\n Analysis: how to avoid scams this Black Friday As we head into the Black Friday sale season, you should expect to see the internet flooded with discounts and Black Friday deals encouraging you to shop. But among these true bargains will be an awful lot of duds.\nWe’re not just talking about situations like the above example – where a user is seemingly scammed into buying one item because they believe it’ll be another – but discounts that aren’t what they appear to be and offers on items you’d be better off avoiding.\nSo what are some best practices you can follow to avoid Black Friday purchases that you come to regret?\nFor starters, you want to only shop at reputable sites that you recognize and that offer some kind of buyer protection. If you’re browsing an online store you’ve never heard of before, look into it. Googling “[Site name] legit” should bring up details about it on websites like Trustpilot. You’ll also likely see links to Reddit posts celebrating or bemoaning the site depending on if it's a hidden gem or a sham. If after your research you’re still not 100% sure, shop elsewhere – the potential extra savings aren't worth the risk.\nYou also want to make sure you're buying from the vendor themselves, and not a third-party that's using the site as a marketplace. Newegg, Amazon, and Walmart are some of the stores that allow other people to sell items on their sites, and while many third-party sellers are fine, there are some bad actors that can slip through the cracks.\nBlack Friday is a great time to find a bargain on a range of gadgets, but not every deal is as good as it looks. (Image credit: Future) Once the site has passed your checks, it’s time for you to check the quality of your desired product, too. Unfortunately despite their best efforts, online stores like Amazon are flooded with fake reviews. While you can use our guide on how to spot fake Amazon reviews to try and separate the real opinions from the mass-produced lies, we’d also recommend again googling the item and trying to find independent reviews for it if you can.\nIf you’re looking to pick up a Black Friday gaming laptop deal, a Black Friday OLED TV deal, a Black Friday air fryer deal, or even a Black Friday coffee machine deal, most likely the model you’re interested in has been reviewed by a publication like TechRadar. We aren’t incentivized to make a product sound better or worse than it really is, so if you want an opinion you can trust on a gadget you like, then read through our review and decide if it's something you want to buy.\nFinally, before you hit buy make sure the discount is as good as it seems. Ahead of Black Friday, it’s not uncommon for brands to raise their prices to then make discounts seem larger than they really are.

Pujara, who joined Sussex last year, made an enormous impact by scoring over 1000 County Championship runs, including a record breaking three double centuries and finished the season with an average of 109.4. The right-handed batter's stupendous form continued into the 50-over Royal London Cup, where he led the side in the absence of injured Tom Haines and guided the team to the semi-finals of the competition. In his nine Royal London Cup appearances, Pujara averaged 89.14 at a strike-right of 111.62, with a highest score of 174 off just 131 balls against Surrey. Promoted \"I am glad to be back with Sussex for the 2023 season. I thoroughly enjoyed my last stint with the club last season, both on and off the field and I'm looking forward to contributing to the team's growth and success in the coming year,\" Pujara said in a statement issued by the county side. Sussex Performance Director, Keith Greenfield, added: \"It is fantastic news that Cheteshwar will be returning in 2023, we all saw the class he showed with the bat and his performances, but he was also outstanding in our young dressing room as a world class role model for them to follow.\"\nndtv\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/cheteshwar-pujara-to-return-to-sussex-for-2023-county-season/","tags":["Cricket"],"title":"Cheteshwar Pujara To Return To Sussex For 2023 County Season"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"M2 iPad Pro reviews: Much like the M1 model, only a handful of people need it Alongside reviews of the new 10th-generation entry-level iPad, M2 iPad Pro reviews are also out – and here reviewers speak with one voice.

The bottom line is that it’s an incredible device, but more or less the same as last year’s M1 model, and very few people will benefit from the performance … (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Mashable says that it’s powerful, and Pencil Hover is a neat trick, but it’s otherwise the same as last year’s M1 model – and if you want the extra power, you should probably buy a MacBook. The sixth-gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which Apple sent me to review last week, is near identical to the fifth-gen iPad Pro in many key aspects. It has the same design, display, cameras, speakers, and battery. It’s exactly the same size and weight. It even has a Nano-SIM slot, just like last year’s iPad Pro, even though Apple has gone SIM-less on its new iPhone 14. It comes with the same storage options, ranging from 128GB all the way up to 2TB. It once again comes in the Space Gray and Silver colors. It supports the exact same accessories, and Apple hasn’t launched any new ones, for now. This is not an upgrade for people who want to flaunt their brand new iPad Pro. The major changes are the M2 processor and – if you really stretch the term “major” – support for Apple Pencil hover, the tech that makes the tablet’s display sense the proximity of Pencil and perform a simple task before you even touch it. Apple’s iPad Pro is for professionals, but only a small niche of professionals can truly use it as a daily driver. Changes boil down to the new M2 chip that’s inside, making the Pro even more powerful, but you’ll be better off with a laptop. TechRadar stacks the latest iPad Pro up against the iPad Air, and concludes that most people don’t need the Pro. You might think that the iPad Air 5 vs iPad Pro 2022 dilemma isn’t really much of a dilemma; after all, the new iPad Pro (2022) – launched alongside the new iPad 10.9 (2022) – brings top-grade laptop performance to the tablet format. But the iPad Air (2022) – Apple’s other big tablet launch from earlier in the year – is no slouch either […] The iPad Pro 2022 is (unsurprisingly) the better, more capable of the two. Its new Apple M2 chip means a healthy bump in performance, and its display – whichever size you opt for – is brighter, more fluid, and (in the case of the 12.9-inch Pro, at least) more vibrant. The Pro also gives you a more advanced camera system, Face ID authentication, improved connectivity, and enhanced Apple Pencil interactivity. But is all that worth the $200/£200 premium that Apple is charging for the 11-inch Pro? For most people, we suspect that it won’t be, as they’re functionally very similar. Indeed our review of the latest Pro notes that the iPad Air 5 offers the vast majority of the Pro’s features for a lot less. Tom’s Guide loves the display, M2 performance, Apple Pencil hover, and 5G support – but sees little advantage over the previous M1 version. I have mixed feelings about the new iPad Pro 2022. Objectively, it’s a well-designed device that delivers everything you’d expect from the premium iPad line. Watching video content, playing games, conferencing with others, web browsing, writing, drawing and more work as well as ever. The M2 chip powering the tablet should also make it fairly future-proof. It’s hard to knock the iPad Pro for what it offers. However, this tablet doesn’t exist in a vacuum. If you already own last year’s iPad Pro, you absolutely don’t need the new model unless you do heavy-duty design or video editing. The iPad Air 2022 is also a great option for most users due to its impressive performance and relative affordability compared to the iPad Pro. And for those who want one of the best Android tablets , the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 is another alternative. However, if you own an older iPad Air or iPad Pro, the iPad Pro 2022 could be just the upgrade you’ve been waiting for. ZDNet ‘s Jason Cipriani says he got to unexpectedly discover that there is zero real-life performance difference. He shares the view of many of us: that it’s the software that needs an update, not the hardware. The iPad Pro’s hardware continues to outpower the software. Although, with the addition of Stage Manager in iPadOS 16.1 and true external monitor support due before the end of the year, iPad Pro users have more hope than ever that the iPad is about to turn the corner. In my early hands-on preview for iPadOS 16, I wrote that the update fundamentally changed the way I use my iPad Pro. For the better; and I stand by that. I admittedly gave Apple the benefit of the doubt that any issues I’d experienced during early testing were bugs in a young beta and that by the time the official release arrived, those bugs would be ironed out. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case […] At one point during the last couple of days, I mistakenly picked up my iPad Pro thinking it was the M2 iPad Pro (they’re identical in design) and used it for an hour or so, the entire time questioning whether the performance boost I suddenly perceived was a placebo effect or not. Turns out, it was. Engadget echoes the point about the extra performance mattering to very few users. That new chip is by far the most notable change here. Otherwise, the design, screen, cameras, storage options, accessories and price are all the same. That’s not a big problem, though, because the iPad Pro was already an outstanding device — and the Liquid Retina XDR display Apple introduced on last year’s 12.9-inch model is still a simply outstanding screen. There are a couple new tricks here, like the Apple Pencil “hover” feature and the ability to shoot video in Apple’s ProRes codec, but by and large this iPad Pro isn’t angled at people who bought that M1 model. Instead, it’s just a case of Apple flexing its muscles by making the most powerful, spare-no-expense tablet that it can […] In a demo last week, Apple showed how the new iPad Pro can chew through apps like the forthcoming DaVinci Resolve and Octane X. The former is an intense video application that combines things like professional-level color correction, color grading, visual effects and much more, while Octane X is meant for 3D rendering. Both apps are pretty far outside things I’d use. Slashgear says that, like the M1 model, it’s an incredibly impressive technical achievement, but most of us don’t need the performance they offer. It was frankly astonishing when Apple added the M1 chipset to the iPad Pro in early 2021. For the first time, the Cupertino firm’s tablets had the same processing potential as its laptops, a narrowing-of-the-field that, though predicted by many, still felt borderline magical in a device that was fanless and still capable of lengthy battery life. As we’ve seen from the Apple M2 in laptops like the 2022 MacBook Air refresh, the delta between the generations of Apple Silicon hasn’t been quite as jaw-dropping as the leap from x86 to M1 was. Nonetheless, it’s tough to understate just what the offer is here: desktop-level grunt. The qualifier — which also lingers from previous, potent iPad Pros — is that how well you can take advantage of the power on offer depends on the whims of developers. DaVinci Resolve, Octane X, and Affinity Publisher users will all be getting updates later in the year that unlock features and processing speed that legitimately would’ve forced them to turn to the Mac version before now. That’s huge. There’s a sense nonetheless that there’s more here from the M2 than is really necessary for most iPadOS apps and iPad users. My typical workflow of email, messaging, browsing, writing, and watching the occasional video barely touches the sides, when you’re talking about a CPU that’s up to 15% faster than last year’s, and a GPU that’s up to 35% faster. Never has the fact that this is a pro machine, and not designed for everyone, been more stark. Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.

In the turbo-hybrid era, Wolff’s side was a group to envy till 2021, which dominated the entire grid. In 2012, the rivalry between the two sides was piqued, as the championship fight couldn’t have gone more intense. Even this year, Wolff became the biggest opposition to Red Bull amidst their budget breach controversy. So, Wolff has left no stone unturned to make things harder for Red Bull. But several years ago, his relations with the Austrian side weren’t bad, and he even represented them once. The Mercedes boss Wolff back when he was a GT driver, was sponsored by his compatriot and Red Bull owner Deiritch Mateshitz. The former Austrian driver claims he was proud of wearing Red Bull colours. “It was on a car that was sponsored by Red Bull but I was proud to wear those colours as a junior driver, GT driver back in the day, and being a Red Bull driver was something prestigious and I was proud to wear the overalls and the team kit,” said Wolff. However, Wolff didn’t continue his driving career for long after realising he wasn’t good enough. He then had a successful spell in the finance industry before he joined the business of F1, and the rest is history. Mateschitz became one of the biggest names when he involved his brand in several sports. From football and F1 to several adventure sports, Red Bull is everywhere. Wolff claims that Mateschitz used to invest a huge amount of his company’s profits in sports. He even credits the late billionaire as the biggest individual contributor to F1. “This one was for Dietrich.” Verstappen dedicates his win in Austin to Dietrich Materschitz ❤️ — ESPN F1 (@ESPNF1) Under Mateschitz’s guidance, Red Bull has won five F1 constructors’ titles and six drivers’ championships.

It’s almost as if he has a personal vendetta against the 4-time NBA Champion. The famous/infamous pundit has gained vast popularity with his campaign against the superstar. Some believe it might be due to the GOAT debate. With Bayless being a Michael Jordan fan, it is difficult for him to acknowledge LeBron’s right to the tag. And to stop his claim to being the GOAT, Bayless has taken it upon himself to criticize and scrutinize LeBron’s career and life. With the Lakers in the midst of a complete breakdown since last season, he has had ample reasons and justifications to go after LBJ. This time, he has reacted to Lakers losing their 3rd game of the season. And it’s safe to conclude he wasn’t kind to the squad or James. Also read: The former first-take host was tweeting while the Lakers were playing the Trail Blazers. Before the start of the fourth quarter, the Hollywood team was leading 83-78. They Portland 35-23 in the third quarter. However, Portland turned the game around in 4th. Skip Bayless in his tweet reacted to the loss. He claimed that LeBron James lacked the clutch gene. He had lost the ability to perform in high-pressure situations. He also took note of how the team gave away a 16-6 run and lost the game. Skip: “LeBron fallaway j to tie – way short! Some things never change. No clutch gene. Lakers give up a 16-6 run at home down the stretch, lose by two to Dame and Co.” — Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) This time, Skip is not the only one who is disappointed in the Lakers. The gold and purple proudly started the 2021-22 season with Russell Westbrook’s inclusion. Things turned south real soon and the momentum has completely been against them since. This season feels more like the continuation of the tragedy that was last year. The three-consecutive losses mean absolutely nothing to the overall seeding prospects of the team yet. However, that will change at a staggering pace. If they notch up a few more losses to their record, LeBron James and his team will risk missing another playoffs.

The elements included in this mineral and its derivatives Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) are less-toxic and abundant on Earth, which could be very advantageous for the development of more sustainable and low-cost technologies.\nOctober 24, 2022 feature by Ingrid Fadelli , Tech Xplore Kesterite (Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 , CZTS) is a sulfide mineral with a unique lattice structure that can be considered as derived from chalcopyrite CuInSe 2 (CIS) by substituting two atoms of In 3+ in the chalcopyrite by one atom of Zn 2+ and one atom of Sn 4+ . The elements included in this mineral and its derivatives Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 (CZTSSe) are less-toxic and abundant on Earth, which could be very advantageous for the development of more sustainable and low-cost technologies. Over the past few decades, material scientists and engineers have been exploring the possibility of using kesterite materials to create more affordable and sustainable solar cells. Despite extensive efforts in this direction, the highest power efficiency attained by kesterite solar cells is 12.6%, which was first reported in 2013. Researchers at Nanjing University of Posts \u0026 Telecommunications, Fudan University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and University of Washington have recently surpassed this decade-long record, developing a better performing kesterite/CdS interface that could enable the creation of solar cells with a 13% efficiency. This interface, presented in a paper published in Nature Energy , could enable the creation of more efficient and better performing kesterite solar cells. \"The Nature Energy paper builds on our previous work, which showed that the kesterites Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 (CZTSSe) and (Ag,Cu) 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 (ACZTSSe) absorbers fabricated from SnCl 4 based DMSO solution show improved device performance with the reduced recombination near kesterite/CdS interface,\" Hao Xin, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told TechXplore. \"The primary objective of the Nature paper was to understand the original of the defective heterojunction interface of kesterite/CdS and how thermal annealing greatly reduces the concentration of the defects.\" In their experiments, Xin and his colleagues showed that a kesterite/CdS heterojunction is constructed on a Zn-poor surface, as Zn 2+ dissolves during the chemical bath deposition process. As a result, Cd 2+ occupies site previously occupied by Zn and Zn 2+ is re-deposited into CdS, resulting in a defective interface with a lattice mismatched. To reconstruct the epitaxial interface, the researchers applied a technique known as low temperature annealing on the kesterite/CdS junction. This technique allowed them to drive the migration of Cd 2+ from the absorber layer back to the CdS site and Zn 2+ from the absorber bulk to the material's surface. \"The precursor films (fabricated from SnCl 4 based DMSO solution) have kesterite (Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 , CZTS) structures already formed, which takes a direct phase transformation grain growth mechanism to form CZTSSe/ACZTSSe absorber films during selenization,\" Xin said. \"Our approach avoids secondary phases and thus creates a uniform and less defective absorber.\" The researchers evaluated the kesterite/CdS interface they created in a series of tests and found that it outperformed previously created kesterite interfaces. Their initial fabrication method was found to significantly improve the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of solar cell devices, achieving certified efficiencies of 12.96% over a small-area (0.11cm 2 ) and 11.7% over a large-area (1.1cm 2 ). In the future, the experimental methods devised by Xin and his colleagues could enable the development of kesterite/CdS interfaces with more uniform absorber films. These interfaces could in turn be used to develop better performing kesterite solar cells. \"For the first time, we unveil how the kesterite/CdS heterojunction is constructed (based on Zn-poor surface) and why it is defective (due to occupation of Cd 2+ on Zn vacancy), which contrast with CIGS, from which kesterite is inherited,\" Xin added. \"In our next works, we plan to further engineer the defects of kesterites.\" Explore further Yuancai Gong et al, Sn4+ precursor enables 12.4% efficient kesterite solar cell from DMSO solution with open circuit voltage deficit below 0.30 V, Science China Materials (2020).

But, a Twitter user, who shared the video, claimed that Dhoni had offered him his seat, saying \"Your legs are too long, sit in my seat (Business Class), I'll sit in Economy.\" After the loss, Pakistan coach Matthew Hayden along with skipper Babar Azam talked to the team giving them a sigh of relief to not take any pressure now. In a video shared by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Babar was seen comforting his players who were shaken-up by the defeat against India, especially Mohammad Nawaz. \"No one should point fingers on one person, this should not happen, not in this team. As a team we have lost, as a team we will win. We have to stick to together, remember that. We have had good performances too. Look at those too.

In addition, they support all seven dhatus (tissues), especially Shukra dhatu, and lubricate the skin and microcirculatory channels (reproductive tissue).\nNew Delhi: These energies control various processes, including controlling the mind, the body, and diseases you are likely to contract or the diet you ought to eat. One of these energies is the Vata dosha, which controls bodily motion and motion-related processes. Ayurveda holds Vata accountable for our capacity for both physical \u0026 mental adaptabilities. It controls our nervous system, bones, and hearing. It is the energising force of the body and mind. Here are three lifestyle tips: Include almonds in your diet: In general, sweet, sour, and salty foods are excellent for balancing Vata. These tastes are regarded as a medicine for correcting Vata imbalance in Ayurveda because they increase qualities of warmth, moisture, and heaviness/groundedness to encourage regular digestion and balance Vata. For a healthy body constitution, it`s generally advised to consume foods that satisfy all six tastes (sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astringent). Almonds are one of the foods that can help balance Vata Dosha. Almonds are typically referred to as \"Vatada,\" \"Badam,\" or \"Vatma\" in Ayurvedic texts. They are considered \"madhura,\" or sweet, and have \"Snigdha,\" or unctuous properties, and are known as \"Vatahara\" and \"Pitta kara\" in terms of their action on doshas (Dosha Karma). Almonds work best to calm the Vata dosha due to their after-digestion sweet and warming qualities. In addition, they support all seven dhatus (tissues), especially Shukra dhatu, and lubricate the skin and microcirculatory channels (reproductive tissue). Practice Yoga: Yoga that calms the Vata dosha can balance all the doshas and provide radiant and beaming health. The asanas that are better suited for Vata balance should naturally becalming. These poses help alleviate anxiety symptoms and correct imbalances, such as bodyaches and constipation. Some of the asanas you could practice every day include Uttanasana (Standing Forward Bend Pose), Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Bend Pose), Balasana(Child`s pose), Supta Virasana (Reclined Hero Pose), Dhanurasana (Bow Pose) and Ustrasana(Camel pose). Adding Ashwagandha to your diet: Several naturally occurring herbs have Vata-optimisingproperties. The herb ashwagandha is renowned for its many Ayurvedic health advantages. Vata dosha imbalance is typically the cause of stress, which frequently manifests as irritability, insomnia, and fear. According to studies, by balancing Vata, taking Ashwagandha powder lessens the signs and symptoms of stress and anxiety. Ashwagandha, usually taken as a powder, can be diluted with water or warm milk and honey. Although it is always recommended to consult your ayurvedic physician for its accurate dose before consumption. This combination supports the reproductive system, builds strength, and balances Vata when taken before bed. It also promotes sound sleep patterns.\nzeenews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/try-these-3-lifestyle-tips-for-balancing-vata-dosha/","tags":[],"title":"Try THESE 3 lifestyle tips for balancing Vata dosha"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Notice Asking Women Advocates To Stop \u0026lsquo;Arranging Hair In Open Court\u0026rsquo; Causes Uproar It is regularly seen that women advocates are styling their hair in open Court, which is disrupting the running of the Court,\" says a notice published by court on October 20,2022.\nNEW DELHI: An image of a court notice of Pune District Court, which senior Supreme Court advocate and well-known human rights activist Indira Jaising shared on Twitter on Sunday has caused quite an uproar on social media. The notice, dated October 20, 2022, instructs women's advocates to forgo hair styling. \"It is regularly seen that women advocates are styling their hair in open Court, which is disrupting the running of the Court,\" reads the controversial notice, which is undersigned by the Registrar of Pune District Court. Women's rights activists were thereby advised to refrain from such behavior. Jaising posted a picture of this warning along with the caption, \"Wow, now look! Who is distracted by women advocates and why!\" The number of likes for this tweet is now over 4,600, with 985 retweets and 237 quote tweets. The court's order is being criticised by online users as being sexist and discriminatory against women. Many among the Twitterati commented on the tweet about women advocates 'arranging their hair in open court, disturbing functioning of the court…' A Twitter user commented on Jaising's tweet saying, \"If they choose to get distracted by the mere sight of women tomorrow, would women advocates be barred as well?

According to a report, he told that this Miya Museum should be taken down immediately He also said that he won't allow the existence of the Miya Museum in Assam as the Miya community will never accept the Assamese Culture. The Miya Museum was opened to the public on Sunday. It is located in the Lakhipur in Dapkarvita in the Goalpara district of the state of Assam. It aims to preserve the culture and heritage of a minor section of people residing in the state. The small setup has old items related to the Miya community on display for all visitors. Apparently, these have been used by the community since a very old time.The inauguration event was attended by hundreds of members of the Miya community as well as invited guests and officials of the All AssamMiya Parishad among the dignitaries.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had previously rejected a proposal of former Congress MLA Sherman Ali Ahmed. He has proposed the of setting up a Miya Museum in Srimanta Shankardev Kalakshetra in the year 2020.

It is promoting guide aided travel for travellers to have an immersive local experience. Oddessemania is incidentally the first platform to facilitate pre-travel guide booking. Trained and experienced guides are onboarded to the platform (based on their specialty) for travellers to select them on the basis of the itinerary, the subject and their availability. The guides are specifically selected from the local community and trained and onboarded. The Oddessemania platform mainly allows travellers to plan their itinerary by using maps and plan the details of the trip visually. Travelers can also share itineraries, if they want, with family and friends. Oddessemania achieves multiple objectives by facilitating guide booking. Firstly the travellers get a local expert to guide them during the travel who ensures that they get an immersive experience. Secondly the local guides also ensure safety of the travellers. This is particularly important for solo travellers or small groups. Thirdly by engaging the local guide community it contributes positively to uplift the local economy. What was the understanding /insight or inspiration behind your entrepreneurial venture? The seed of entrepreneurship was sown in my mind when I was in college. I used to attend the seminars and workshops where the founders of the companies used to come and take sessions. I was inspired to work on my own and solve problems from that point of time only. Also, I and my co-founder are travel freaks. Since we are from the northeast we wanted to showcase our beauty, culture and tradition to everyone. We realised people outside the region have lot of misunderstandings about this region. We started Oddessemania keeping all these objectives in mind. We chose to make the guide booking platform because we observed that when people come to visit places they are not introduced to the local culture, tradition or the people of those places. They come through agencies that give them luxurious facilities and hardly contribute to the local economic growth. Most people residing in the offbeat places are dependent on tourists. The big 'moneyed' players take advantage of this fact and open up big franchisee of hotels or restaurants and this is not actually fair. The northeast is yet to be explored and we have to capitalise on our local communities. Therefore, it's now our mission through this startup to uplift the local communities and contribute to the local economy. What are the specific challenges and milestones of your journey so far? What is your vision and future roadmap? Well orienting the society (at large) to your idea is the main challenge that you face when you start your journey as an entrepreneur. Our idea is completely new so doing this was doubly challenging for us. Finding the correct mentor to guide us was another challenge. I and my co-founder Prantika Sarma are first generation entrepreneurs and hence we were easily prone to mistakes. We didn't have anyone to guide us and enlighten us about the correct ways. I would say that finding and forming the right team in a startup is a very big challenge because you need someone who is ready to do extra work and research while putting in creativity always. The members also have to believe in entrepreneurship and the idea that you chose to work on. Finding knowledgeable and creative people who align with the company values and goals is a real task. And obviously, funding is always a perennial challenge to start something new. Our company is boot strapped but some amount of fund is always required to scale up and finding the correct investor that believes in your idea is not at all easy. However, with all our efforts and proper mentorship, we have served 3000 plus customers till date and trained 80 plus guides to onboard them in our app. We also started experiential learning programmes among students and corporates and received a huge response and have already served 200 plus participants. We got incubated in Assam start-up, recognised by IIMCIP and DPIIT and received a soft loan and incubation from the Assam Downtown venture lab. Our website is one of the top travel websites in northeast India. And this happened because we worked on the basics during corona time. Recently, we also collaborated with Assam Tourism to train the registered guides and onboard them in our platform so that they are available to the tourists for booking. We are the official company to provide guides in Assam now. Our future plan is expand the guide system in different north-eastern states as well as in other parts of the country. Our platform is the first platform which is giving recognition and mass employment to the local youths as local guides. We also aim to expand in South Asian countries because the guide demands are more overseas. We are currently in talks with Singapore for this. Moreover, we also aim to expand our experiential learning programmes in various institutions (both educational and corporate). What are the social objectives of your entrepreneurial venture? How do you envisage making a positive impact on the ecosystem in which your enterprise is operating?Our main goal is to uplift the local community and train them to be employed. We aim to change the way people travel by giving them alternate facilities like pre-guide booking for an immersive experience, switching from hotels to locally owned homestays, exploring lesser known trails, enjoying the culture and eating locally made food with the local people rather than dining in fancy restaurants. We do not allow the participants in our experiential learning programmes to bring plastics and we also run cleanliness drives. As I said earlier we have already trained 80 plus guides and impacted 200 plus families whose regular income depends on us. Within 3 years, we plan to train and onboard 2000 plus guides and connect local and remote homestays in our app to make them available to the travelling community. How important is training and mentoring for an entrepreneur? Which are the organisations that are building entrepreneurs in our state ? Any other facilitating factors that are needed? A Mentor is like KRISHNA to ARJUN for the founder. More than funding, mentors are important because they share knowledge through their experience. With all the advice and guidance, you can avoid making mistakes and gain traction on the route to your goals. A mentor also helps you to build and grow a robust network. The mentor is the person who will objectively criticise you on your face so that you can correct your mistakes and be focussed. Organisations like Assam Start-up and Downtown venture lab are giving the best opportunities in this case. There are also other educational institutions who have established entrepreneurship cells to inspire young aspirants in this field. How did you go about looking for an investor or seed funding? What are some of the standard criteria that they look for in an entrepreneurial venture? Networking is one of the gold mines where you can find not only investors, but mentors, co-founders and dedicated employees as well. There are many platforms where you can do networking and one of the gold mines is LinkedIn. I must say that we observed that students in this part of the country are not taught to build resumes or portfolios. They don't even know what LinkedIn is and it's actually a shame. Other than that, there are tons of events organised all across the globe where you can pitch to get investors, incubation and mentoring. All these information is found in LinkedIn only. We at least felt this way because we were able to connect with our mentor, investor and media houses through LinkedIn. Some things that an investor considers in terms of the venture or the founder include the following: • The product and its innovation. • The potential of the idea. • The market size where you will be launching it. • The team that is working to make it big. • The leadership and dedication of the founders. • Financials. How much do you credit technology for the success of your business? Can you please share your views? Technology has a huge impact on us in terms of scaling up our business as well as visibility. Our entire system depends on technology. Previously, we were doing business in a traditional way and providing good services. However, we were not able to maintain many things such as guide verifications and availability, safety confirmations etc. With technology all our activities have got swifter and we are able to manage everything smoothly and now growing the company to the next level. It shall not be an exaggeration to say that it is only because of technology that we are able to bring this new revolution in the travel industry. This is not to discount the help and support that we had from other crucial quarters.Also Read: The Jinx of AmolaAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/a-startup-that-is-changing-the-paradigm-of-travel/","tags":["Life,Melange,Supplements,More"],"title":"A Startup that is Changing the Paradigm of Travel"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Vaastu Rules for Windows and Staircases The number of windows in a house should always be even like 4, 6, 8, 10 etc. Double paneled windows are more auspicious than single paneled ones. Windows should open towards the inside.\nMany people are of the opinion that vaastu is not applicable to apartments and flats. However, this is not true and the effects of vaastu are the same for all kinds of constructions/buildings. Since unlike independent houses, apartments do not have open areas, the windows play a great role. They are the entry points for air, light and energy. So it is important to have windows in proper places adhering to vaastu rules.Windows at the South and West If you require windows at the South and West, have small windows. However, if there are already open spaces at the South and West, windows should be avoided as far as possible. The Northeast and East The Northeast and East should have bigger windows. This will allow more sunlight and air into the house resulting in more positive energy. The Number of Windows The number of windows in a house should always be even like 4, 6, 8, 10 etc. Double paneled windows are more auspicious than single paneled ones. Windows should open towards the inside. This allows energy to come inside. Avoid windows at the Southwest just like doors. Staircase RulesThis is one area which is neglected by many. A staircase built in the wrong direction and in defiance (opposition) of vaastu norms can upset the vaastu of the entire house/building. The staircase is considered the secondary gateway of pranic energy to the upper floors. The Southwest should be kept heavy at all times. Therefore a staircase at the Southwest is considered the best. West and South are also good directions for building a staircase. Under NO circumstances, should a staircase be built at the Northeast as doing this will lead to a blockade of the Northeast. Southeast is also not bad to have the staircase but there may be some other problems associated with this direction. An external staircase can be built in the South-east facing the East, South-west facing the West, Northwest facing the North and Southwest facing the South. The staircase should always have an odd number of stairs and the number must never end with a zero i.e. 10, 20 etc. While climbing the stairs, the face of the person MUST face the South or West. A spiral staircase is not advisable as it is believed to cause bad health. Moreover a staircase encircling the building should be avoided as this is believed to cause calamites. A room having a staircase in the Southwest corner of a basement is not auspicious. It is advisable to have doors at the end and beginning of a staircase. The staircase should NOT be built in the centre or Brahmasthan of the house. This will pose all sorts of problems for the residents. A staircase should not be visible to visitors. Broken stairs must be repaired immediately. The space below the staircase should be left vacant. This will help the education of students. Toilet should NOT be built under the staircase. Kitchen, store room or Puja rooms are forbidden under the staircase. Use of Aparajita (Blue pea/Butterfly pea) flower in vaastu The Blue Aparajita is also known as Blue pea or Butterfly pea (pigeonwings).In vaastu shastra, this flower has a big role. The Aparajita is mainly found in white and blue colours. The blue variety is liked by Lord Vishnu. So it is also known as Krishnakanta or Vishnukanta. Financial growth of a household increases with the growth of the blue Aparajita. This flower is capable of bringing peace and happiness.Benefits of Blue Aparajita: 1. Negative energy is expelled and positive energy multiplies with Blue Aparajita. 2. Since Lord Vishnu likes this flower, Aparajita is also considered to be a favourite flower of Goddess Lakshmi. It is believed that this flower attracts riches and ushers rewards of hard work. 3. It is believed that by planting the Blue Aparajita, the intellectual ability of people increases. The members of a house are never at a loss if they offer this flower to Lord Vishnu regularly. 4. Blue is the colour of Lord Shani (Saturn). It is believed that if the Blue Aparajita is offered to Shanidev, he will be pleased and will free the giver from all ill and malefic effects of Saturn. The direction of growing and keeping the Blue Aparajita: The north is the best direction to keep this plant because the North is ruled by Goddess Lakshmi as well as Lord Kuber. It should not be planted at the South or West. Some people are of the opinion that since blue is Shani's favourite colour; this flower should be kept at the West. However, it is not so. Some Vaastu Tips For Keeping Cash 1. Keep the area neat and clean where you keep cash. 2. Keep a silver coin with Goddess Lakshmi in your safe or cash box. 3. Never keep your money in your cash box with important files and documents. 4. Never leave your cash box empty. Always make sure that there is at least a one-rupee coin in it. 5. DO NOT keep your safe or cash box in the last or first room of your house. 6. Don't place your cash box near a window or ventilator. This is also common sense against easy theft. 7. Keep your valuables in a place (which is well lit and has positive energy) on a Thursday. 8. Keep 11 Gomti chakras wrapped in yellow cloth in the cash box Reader queries My house has a verandah at the East extending from Northeast to Southeast. I need to have a room for my maid. Where can I construct the room by using the verandah? P Lyngdoh, Shillong. The Southeast is the best portion to build this room. DO NOT construct it at the Northeast or East. I have an open car shed at the Northeast with a tinned roof touching my house. I am constructing a new car shed at the Northwest as suggested by you. Can I convert the old car shed into a store? Ashok Das, Lakhimpur A big NO!! Store room at Northeast will affect your finances and arrest growth.

And a lot of people were not happy. The blowback was so intense that Apple had to release a special tool to remove it. And it was all Bono’s fault, as he explained in an interview with The Guardian over the weekend.When Bono approached Tim Cook, along with Eddy Cue and Phil Schiller about the idea, he was met with some incredulity. \"Are you talking about free music?\" Cook said.In Bono’s words: \"'No,' I said, 'I don’t think we give it away free. I think you pay us for it and then you give it away free, as a gift to people.'\" Cook was apparently not convinced, asking if it would be distributed only to U2 fans, and the singer replied: “I think we should give it away to everybody.” No, Bono, no!– Mat SmithThe Morning After isn’t just a newsletter – it’s also a daily podcast.

If you are feeling a bit drained or pressured, find someone you care about and give them an all-enveloping hug. Because research has found that embracing reduces the amount of cortisol (stress hormone) in our bodies, releasing tension and sending calming messages to the brainSince decades, medical practitioners and wellness experts have acknowledged the importance of physical touch in terms of a human being's overall psychological and even biological wellbeing. Hugging probably tops the range of physical expressions that facilitate and accelerate this wellbeing. Hugging can be described as a handshake from the heart. The simple action of embracing creates feel-good energy for both the giver and recipient. Science has been looking into its positive effects, and numerous studies related to hugging, cuddling and touching have been reaching the same conclusion—hugging is a crucial part of human development. According to psychologists human beings are in need of at least eight hugs or more a day. Talking about some specific benefits of hugging, Neetu Goswami a Guwahati based psychiatrist says, \"Hugging is simply healthy for the heart. Embracing activates the hormone oxytocin, which makes us feel good. In my experience as a psychiatrist I have actually observed that most depression patients do not have regular physical intimacy (by way of hugs and kisses) with their family or friends.\" Hugging also reduces stress naturally. \"If you are feeling a bit drained or pressured, find someone you care about and give them an all-enveloping hug. Because research has found that embracing reduces the amount of cortisol (stress hormone) in our bodies, releasing tension and sending calming messages to the brain,\" explains Goswami. Touch is critical to infants, especially in their early stages of life as it helps them bond with others as they get older. Hugging is important for adults, too. Physical touch and hugging can combat feelings of loneliness that arise as people get older. Informing about another benefit of hugging, Goswami says hugging can make you a more mindful and present person. According to him hugging can also minimize fears. \"A recent study (conducted in US) on fears and self-esteem looked into the connection between human touch and reducing the fear of mortality. Participants were more likely to have less anxiety towards death when being lightly touched or hugging an inanimate object like a teddy bear,\" he shares. Overall hugging for longer periods of time is better for the body. \"When people hug for 20 seconds or more, the feel-good hormone oxytocin is released which creates a stronger bond and connection between the huggers. Oxytocin has been shown to boost the immune system and reduce stress,\" sums Dr Goswami. There are some cultures that are more receptive to hugging as a social phenomenon. Dr Goswami says that although there are no definite studies to prove it, people hailing from such communities also tend to live longer.Also Read: About a Winter Night's MirageAlso Watch: sentinel\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/hug-your-way-to-a-healthy-and-happy-life/","tags":["Life,Melange,Supplements,More"],"title":"Hug your Way to a Healthy and Happy Life"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Video: PM Modi sings \u0026lsquo;Maa Tujhe Salaam\u0026rsquo; along with soliders at Kargil on Diwali- WATCH He also laid a wreath at the Kargil War Memorial and paid tribute to the army personnel who lost their lives here in 1999.

The 18th match of the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup between South Africa and Zimbabwe has been reduced to a nine-over contest due to inclement weather conditions in Hobart. Although the 17th match between Netherlands and Bangladesh in the afternoon didn’t witness any weather interruption at the same venue, the start of this match got delayed by over a couple of hours. Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine won the toss and chose to bat in anticipation of a 20-over innings but had to walk out to bat alongside wicket-keeper batter Regis Chakabva knowing that he would have to accelerate from the word go. Aakash Chopra propounds rule change in T20 World Cup points system Former India batter Aakash Chopra, who is part of Star Sports Network’s Hindi commentary roaster for this World Cup, took to social media platform Twitter to propound a rule change with respect to the points system. Chopra, 45, suggested that ICC (International Cricket Council) should initiate bonus points in T20 World Cups. Chopra’s thought behind saying so was inspired particularly from matches which get abandoned due to rain. In the general run of things, both teams share a point each in abandoned matches. However, the nature of the beast is such that losing a point to rain has it in it to affect a team’s probability of qualifying for the next round, i.e., semi-finals. We must have a Bonus Point in the #T20WorldCup No team can afford a rained out game…Bonus point, at least, allows you a serious chance of making up for a lost point. — Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) October 24, 2022 Although the weather will always remain an uncontrollable factor in sport, bonus points would give teams opportunities of making up for lost points due to poor weather. For the unversed, a bonus points is generally awarded for a team winning a match by a gargantuan margin (like 10 wickets or a certain number of runs). Other than the bonus point, former India pacer Ajit Agarkar also put forward a clause regarding teams getting to change their Playing XIs before the start of a rain-affected match such as the one being played at the Blundstone Arena. Agarkar’s rationale behind the same was teams’ strategies having it in them to get changed in such a shortened contest.

How to use the World Clock World Clocks allow you to see different time zones from different regions around the world all in one area. You can add as many clocks as you would like. How to add a clock to the tab in macOS Ventura Select the World Clock tab Tap the Plus icon in the upper right of the screen A search box will appear. Type in the area and/or zone you want to know the time from Once you select the place you have searched, it will show up in the World Clocks tab with a clock telling its time To delete a clock, just hover your cursor over the clock and an \"X\" will appear in the upper left. Click on it to delete it. How to use Alarm on macOS Ventura Alarms allow you to select an important time that you want your Mac to alert you. Adding an Alarm is very similar on macOS as it is on iOS . Open the Clock App Navigate to the Alarm tab Click on the Plus icon in the upper right Click on the hour or minute to change the time Type in what time you want the alarm to go off Select if it is in the AM or PM If you want the alarm to repeat itself , click on what days you would like the alarm to go off Name the alarm next to the section titled \"Label\" Select what sound you would like to sound when the alarm goes off The checkbox next to \"Snooze\" will automatically be selected, but unselect it if you do not want a Snooze option to be present when the alarm goes off Select \"Save\" to implement the alarm or \"Cancel\" to forfeit the creation Once the alarm is saved, if you want to edit it later, you can click on the alarm you want to edit and it will bring you into the settings from before when setting up the alarm. To delete an alarm, hover your cursor over it and an \"X\" will appear. Click on it to delete the alarm. Alarms are not synced between devices, so if you create one on your Mac, it will not show up on your iPhone and/or iPad. How to use the Stopwatch in macOS Ventura The Stopwatch allows you to record time for certain events or activities. When going into the Stopwatch tab, you can click on Start to begin the Stopwatch. Click on Stop to end it. Clicking on Lap while the Stopwatch is running will record specific times that you find important and want to look back at when finishing the Stopwatch. Click Reset to wipe the Stopwatch time and start over. The Stopwatch on macOS works very similarly to how it does on iOS and iPadOS . How to use Timer in macOS Ventura The Timer allows you to set a specific amount of time that you want to be notified. Here is how to set a Timer in macOS. Click on the Timer tab Click on the hours, minutes, or second to change how much you want to add to the timer Select the sound you want to be played once the timer goes off Select Start once everything is to your liking There are multiple ways to end a timer. Here are the options on how to stop them. You can swipe the notification away to end it You can press the X on the notification Click on Options in the notification. Select Stop to stop the timer. Select Repeat to start the timer over. Click on Done in the Timer tab to cancel the timer You can set as many timers as you want when creating them. They can also be edited at any time after creation. What Siri can do with the Clock app in macOS Ventura Performing voice commands to Siri on the Mac works the same as it would on the iPhone or iPad with the Clock app. To activate Siri, you can use \"Hey Siri\" - if you have it enabled, click on the Siri icon next to the time in the toolbar, or hold the microphone icon above the 5 and 6 keys on the keyboard (you can find what the Siri keyboard shortcut is in your Siri settings). Siri can, for now, set alarms and start timers. Ask Siri to set an alarm for a specific time and she will set it, with a preview of the alarm will appear under her response. You can turn the alarm on or off from her response. The alarm will also be located in the Clock app — with the other alarms — where you can edit and delete it if you want to. Ask Siri to start a timer for a specific amount of time and it will start it. A preview of the timer will show under her response. The timer will be in the Clock app once set. You can edit, check, or cancel it from within the app. Siri can also tell you the time in different zones. Just say \"What time is it in London?\" (for example), or another location, and Siri will tell you. Keep track of time The Clock app in macOS Ventura works fairly similar to the application on the iOS and iPadOS platforms. The functions it performs are nearly identical. Adding world clocks, setting alarms and timers, and starting a stopwatch are easy to understand how to do on the Mac when first using it. To make it easier, Siri can also perform some of those tasks - like setting a timer or an alarm - as well.

Did you know that you can use the Pixel Watch charger to top up the Pixel Buds or Pixel Buds Pro? Yes, it actually works. Wireless charging comes in a number of guises, and while the Pixel Watch uses a form of wire-free charging, it only works with the in-the-box magnetic charging puck . In complete contrast, the 2020 Pixel Buds and Pixel Buds Pro can be topped up using reverse wireless charging on your phone and just about any Qi wireless charging dock or station. Interestingly, the Pixel Watch charger is also capable of topping up the Pixel Buds and Buds Pro too. Nowhere in Google’s marketing materials or spec sheets is this listed. It’s a little like the lesser-known trick that means you can effectively place the Pixel Buds A-series to any magnetic surface. After visiting my parents, I forgot my regular USB-C charge cable, which was even more annoying when I wound up with a dead pair of Pixel Buds Pro following a train journey. Luckily, I had packed my Pixel Watch charger so I decided to try putting the earbuds on the puck. To my surprise, after a few seconds, the case light powered on to indicate that my earbuds were indeed charging. PSA: You can charge the Pixel Buds with the Pixel Watch charger. pic.twitter.com/1vi8yjyAQZ — Damien Wilde (@iamdamienwilde) October 24, 2022 Given that the Pixel Watch will incorrectly indicate charging on certain Qi pads, I decided to leave my dead Pixel Buds for a little while to see if this was legit. Even after making it home, I thought this could be a fluke. So for the past couple of days, I’ve tested it multiple times. On every occasion, my earbuds and case are taking and holding a charge just fine. Here’s the short story: It turns out that, yes, you can charge the Pixel Buds or Pixel Buds Pro using the Pixel Watch charger. Because the Pixel Watch charger puck is magnetic, it’ll also stick to the back of your earbuds. You may need to adjust slightly, as the concave shape that is designed for the back of the Pixel Watch doesn’t sit perfectly with the Pixel Buds. That said, once placed, the charge light indicator will begin to flash, and, voila, your favorite earbuds are now getting a little bit of extra juice. Obviously, the lack of Qi wireless charging on the Pixel Buds A-series means that you’re out of luck when using the affordable earbuds. However, if you do have the excellent Pixel Buds Pro or the discontinued Pixel Buds (2020) and don’t have a dedicated wireless charger, this is a great dual-purpose alternative.

With a new CPU and Dynamic Island, the iPhone 14 Pro represented a more extensive update. Here, I have laid out my review of the latest iPhone model and what new things it has to offer its audience and fans. Build and Design If you’re upgrading from an older iPhone, the iPhone 14 Pro has a whole new look. But it is the same when compared to the iPhone 13. It has a similar boxy shape with flat sides, which account for an excellent grasp and in-hand feel. Although, if you prefer using your iPhone without a case, keep a wipe handy for those annoying fingerprint marks that you’re absolutely going to get on the back! A slight difference from its predecessor is the back camera module, which bulges out higher than before. This makes it a bit trickier to type when the phone is laid out on a flat surface as it wobbles a bit. Image: Dinesh Sharma/BGR The buttons on iPhone 14 Pro offer a pleasant sensation to touch. There are two speaker grilles at the bottom, and the earpiece at the top also doubles as a speaker. The sound quality from these is loud and crystal clear, with some bass added to it, which can be felt through the frame of the device. The model comes with a pill-shaped camera module with a lens positioned diagonally. The screen now flaunts an interactive surface called the Dynamic Island around what in other models is just a blank cut-out area. I think the Dynamic Island experience is better on the Pro model rather than the Pro Max model since it has a smaller screen, and you can reach the Dynamic Island display comparatively easily. Color possibilities for the iPhone 14 include silver, gold, space Black, and a new deep purple option to choose from. The iPhone 14 has solid build quality. It’s easier to grasp and use than earlier iPhone models. If you dislike the current trend of huge phones, the iPhone 14 Pro will appeal to you because of its ideal size. It’s perfect for people who prefer a sturdy, minimalistic, and compact build for their phones, as I do. Personally, I’m not too fond of large phones. Thus, I think the iPhone 14’s size is ideal. It can easily fit within a pair of pants pockets and is small enough to be operated with one hand throughout the day. Camera Performance Compared to previous models, the experience with the daylight camera has been significantly enhanced, and the colours are much nicer. iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max offer four cameras, three in the back and one in front. The iPhone 14 Pro sports a primary camera with a wide-angle lens, a 3x telephoto, and an ultrawide camera on the back. Like before, there is only one front camera with a 3D ToF scanner for Face ID. This scanner also supports portrait mode and focus. My favourite Camera upgrades: The phone’s camera has a ton of options that may be used to take various types of pictures. Deep Fusion, Portrait mode, Night Mode, and Burst Mode are a few of these characteristics. Every camera supports video capture in 4K at 60fps with expanded dynamic range and cinematic stabilization. All cameras and all shooting modes support Dolby Vision HDR capture. The Cinematic Mode now supports up to 4K HDR recording at 30fps and is compatible with the primary, telephoto, and selfie cameras. New stabilization options include Action mode and Enhanced Stabilization. Image: Dinesh Sharma/BGR The iPhone 14 Pro has several photography enhancements. The phone takes incredibly detailed pictures in good lighting, and the colours are beautifully captured. The ultrawide camera performs admirably and captures even some of the most minor details in far-off structures. Apple has made some software adjustments to enhance the front camera experience too. The iPhone 14 Pro is a significant upgrade for users, so I would vouch for this to be a good iPhone upgrade when considering camera quality. Dynamic Island Let’s talk about one of the most incredible things to come out of this release. Here’s what gives iPhone 14 Pro the edge over its competitors and predecessors. iPhone users can now view a variety of controls and information, including music, timers, ‘Now Playing,’ and system-wide alerts like AirPods connecting. The most recent high-end iPhones introduce a feature called Dynamic Island that creates an entirely new section at the top of the display where system-wide notifications and contextual information now appear at the top instead of obscuring other iOS components. Image: Dinesh Sharma/BGR With Dynamic Island, iPhone users now have the option to multitask and view all ongoing activities. Users can gather all of their actions in one location rather than browsing apps one at a time. Dynamic Island can follow live activities like Map directions, check their notifications, manage AirDrop connections, set a timer, manage AirDrop connections, and play music. Display Along with Dynamic Island, another thing that sets iPhone 14 Pro apart from its predecessors is its display screen. The 14 Pro has a brighter, more vibrant display that performs amazingly even in outdoor settings. This is because of its 6.1-inch OLED Super Retina XDR ProMotion screen sporting a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. This display changes its refresh rate to adapt to what you’re doing. The advanced display hardware also supports AOD (Always-on Display) mode to make the phone look alive even when you’re not using it. Under any lighting situation, the iPhone 14 Pro provides an excellent viewing experience. I discovered that a brightness level of about 50% was sufficient indoors. Since most of my time is spent indoors, I was pleasantly surprised by the fantastic screen performance under low lighting conditions. Image: Dinesh Sharma/BGR Battery Life It is impossible to ignore the fact that iPhones have had a long history of battery issues. I cannot deny how disappointing the older models were in terms of their battery life when compared to androids. But the good side of it relies on the fact that Apple can bring in considerable changes to the battery’s shelf life, as seen in the latest models like the 13 Pro series. I believe the battery life has improved even more with the iPhone 14 Pro. According to Apple, the 3,200mAh battery inside the iPhone 14 Pro can support 23 hours of movie playback. I used the phone to play mobile games, scroll across applications, mainly Instagram and WhatsApp, and binge-watch YouTube or any TV series, and I found myself with a phone that lasted for about 15 hours of screen time. The new iPhone 14 has Pro MagSafe wireless charging up to 15W, much as the iPhone 13. Once more, the packaging contains no charging adapter. There is a USB-C to lightning cable in the retail packaging. Software Performance If you’re upgrading from an earlier iPhone, the performance of the iPhone 14 Pro is another significant improvement. The phone flaunts a 4nm A16 Bionic chipset, 6 core CPU with 2 performance and 4 efficiency cores, 5 core GPU, and 16 core Neural Engine with IOS 16. The A16 Bionic chipset’s energy conservation and, of course, the AI engines that make things like AR features and power management possible are its finest qualities. Another potential upgrade for Apple users is the 6GB RAM as compared to the 4GB in the iPhone 13. This makes the iPhone 14 Pro probably the fastest smartphone on the market today! There are several apparent benefits of iOS 16, which is the default operating system for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The lock screen can be personalized with widgets, images, and other features. Other prominent characteristics include the restoration of the battery percentage display and the option to edit and unsend texts. Image: Dinesh Sharma/BGR The A16 is a powerful chip that performs multitasking, gaming, and all other tasks performed on the iPhone admirably. Therefore, using the iPhone 14 Pro won’t present any performance concerns for you. I did a lot of browsing on the iPhone 14 Pro, checking and responding to emails, and doing a lot more. The phone effectively handles everything. One of the nicest features is that the iPhone 14 Pro never gets warm even after being put through a lot of use, not even while it is charging. Price The base 128GB variant of the iPhone 14 Pro has a starting price of ₹129900.00 in India. Three more options are available: 256GB for ₹139900.00, 512GB for Rs ₹159900.00, and 1TB for 179900.00. Final Verdict: Is it worth it? We all know that the newest iPhone is always the most desirable one. It seems like every year, when a new iPhone model is released, people rush to their nearest Apple Store to get their hands on it. The question that often comes to mind is: are they really worth the money? Well, if you’re looking for a quick answer, then yes, the iPhone 14 Pro is definitely worth it! Especially people who still use older iPhone models, such as the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR, should absolutely upgrade to the iPhone 14 Pro. For users of the year-old iPhone 13, there might not be a drastic upgrade in the new model, but with the introduction of Dynamic Island and improvements like RAM, battery life, and camera performance, the iPhone 14 Pro is definitely worth investing in for the long run if you want to ride with the trends and enjoy a smooth functioning phone with a quality build.

The project to create a youth scientific laboratory of ice engineering was developed at the Amur State University named after Sholom Aleichem. The rector of the university, Natalia Bazhenova, speaking at the defense of the draft program for its development, said that both the scientific and educational fields would be concentrated around such a laboratory, the training programs for masters and graduate students would be reformatted, and a cohort of young scientists would be formed. The scientific results of the laboratory of ice engineering are directly related to the needs of the Jewish Autonomous Region. We are talking about the development of new effective methods for the destruction of the ice cover during the elimination of congestion on rivers during periods of freeze-up and ice drift, as well as the extension of the navigation of freezing rivers and reservoirs. New devices can be designed to clear roads from snow, remove ice from contact networks and power lines, EAOMedia news agency writes with reference to Bazhenova. As for the target model for the development of PSU named after Sholom Aleichem, by 2030 it should become a center for generating unique opportunities for the development of the human and socio-economic potential of the Far East region. The strategic project entitled “Live, study and work in the Far East” consists of the scientific project “ProNauku” and projects aimed at implementing policies within the framework of the university development program. Earlier it was reported that a study was carried out on the territory of the JAO on how reinforced ice behaves at crossings. They will be dealt with by the scientist Alexei Vasiliev, who received a grant of 300,000 rubles for this purpose as part of the governor’s competition.\nthenewsglory\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/ice-engineering-laboratory-to-be-created-in-the-jewish-autonomous-region/","tags":["World"],"title":"Ice engineering laboratory to be created in the Jewish Autonomous Region"},{"categories":["world"],"contents":"Tomorrow almost a quarter of the sun will be eclipsed: ‘Pretty good chance of good visibility’ There is a good chance that we will be able to see part of the solar eclipse tomorrow in the Netherlands.

That is according to Weeronline, which predicts that there will also be moments with clearings around midday between the thin cloud veils. At its peak, the sun is 22 percent shielded. The solar eclipse begins Tuesday morning at 11:08 a.m. Around noon, at 12.05 sharp, it is at its peak and almost a quarter of the sun in the Netherlands is covered by the moon. Then it seems as if a bite has been taken out of the sun. At 1:03 p.m., the moon has completely moved away from the sun. The weather will be much better than today, which will increase the chance of a good view of the solar eclipse. In the west of the country there may still be some rain, in the rest of the country it will remain as good as dry, according to Weeronline. There are some high, thin clouds, with blue skies in between. “This makes it quite likely to get a good view of the sun for some time around noon,” says Roosmarijn Knol of Weeronline. Tuesday’s solar eclipse minute by minute. © Weerplaza Need Eclipse Glasses If you want to view the eclipse safely, you must use special eclipse glasses. Staring directly at the sun, even during a darkening, causes eye damage. Damage to the retina can even lead to blindness. The eclipse glasses are made of a special foil that filters the sunlight and allows you to look directly at the sun for up to thirty seconds. The glasses are for sale online or at the optician. Nowhere 100 percent dark Often when there is a partial solar eclipse in the Netherlands, the moon moves completely in front of the sun elsewhere in the world. But not this year. In parts of Russia, the sun is more than half covered, with 82 percent in the best spot. So it gets very dark there. On the map below you can see how dark it gets. The eclipse can only be seen over parts of Africa, the Middle East, Asia and especially Europe. The sun is nowhere in the world completely eclipsed. The solar eclipse is greatest in part of Russia, with a maximum of 82 percent. © Weerplaza Did you miss a solar eclipse? If it is too cloudy, or you miss the solar eclipse for some other reason, you don’t have to mourn very long. In 2.5 years, the next one will be on March 29, 2025.

Usually, it's what to have for breakfast. And believe me when I say that this is one of the best decisions you can make for the entire day. Because after fasting for an average of 6-8 hours while you sleep, breaking the fast is imperative to have the energy to begin the day right. A healthy and fulfilling breakfast is the fuel that replenishes your body energy with nutrients and minerals offering you the necessary boost to get back to work. Here's a closer look at why you should make it a point to make the first meal of the day a priority, without exception: If you are keen about losing excess weight, it's a cardinal dietary sin to skip breakfast regularly. The habit of consuming power-packed, wholesome breakfasts shortly after waking up helps to curb your hunger pangs throughout the day. This further leads to less chances of overeating and helps you consciously make nutritious choices when it comes to your other meals. So, if you are keeping tabs on your weight, a nutritious breakfast is not an option, it IS the only option to keep obesity at bay. A healthy breakfast not only kick starts your day and keeps your health in check but also decreases the risk of contracting heart disease in the long run. Studies have linked breakfast skippers to increased chances of clogged arteries. That also opens the door to other lifestyle diseases such as high cholesterol, hypertension, obesity, and many more, which leads to higher risk of strokes and heart attacks. Studies have also proven that having breakfast reduces the chances of getting Diabetes since it minimises the insulin spikes in your blood and keeps insulin resistance at bay. On the other hand, missing breakfast habitually can be correlated to developing Type 2 Diabetes caused by persistent insulin resistance. By skipping breakfast, you allow your body's insulin levels to drop and spike again sharply post lunch -- the most foolproof way to getting Type 2 Diabetes. If you eat breakfast regularly, you are giving your brain a necessary boost and thus are mentally sharper to those who skip it. You will notice that your short-term memory is enhanced, equipping you with increased concentration and productivity levels. Whenever you skip breakfast, you invariably begin to feel hungry later and be drawn to junk food frequently than you would have if you had eaten a healthy breakfast. This is a direct result of the decision fatigue, comes from being hungry and low on energy. Hence, always eat a hearty breakfast to keep your blood sugar, insulin, and energy levels stable in the best way. Since eating breakfast restores your body's glucose levels, it aids brain constant functioning throughout the day. This way, by making it a habit of eating breakfast on time regularly, you also boost your metabolism in the correct fashion. By having a nutritious breakfast daily, you also tend to meet your body's daily dose of required vital nutrients, vitamins, and minerals as compared to people who tend to skip having breakfast. If you include protein, whole grains, unpolished pulses, low-fat dairy and tons of fresh fruits and vegetables in your breakfast, you are all set for a great day ahead. It is not for nothing that breakfast is considered as most important meal of the day. Anybody who is serious about sustaining good health, maintaining an optimal body weight, keeping most chronic lifestyle diseases at bay must make it a mandatory part of their daily routine to take time out every morning and have a hearty, wholesome breakfast soon after waking up. Skipping it is not an option! (Amarnath Halember, Executive Director and CEO, NextG Apex India Pvt.

The new study led by the University of Waterloo in Canada aimed to investigate the relationship between vaccine hesitancy, psychological factors associated with anxiety, and individuals' reasoning for and against getting the vaccine. \"People with anxiety difficulties were not more hesitant about the vaccine. Rather, the more discomfort they had with uncertainty, the less hesitant they were,\" said Dr Christine Purdon, professor of Clinical Psychology at Waterloo in a paper published in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders. \"The opposite was true of those without anxiety, suggesting that discomfort with uncertainty may be an important factor when addressing vaccine hesitancy,\" Purdon added. To conduct the study, the researchers surveyed 148 participants with and without anxiety disorders. All participants completed an online questionnaire examining Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy along with other related variables such as conspiracy beliefs, individualism, and intolerance of uncertainty. They also surveyed the top reasons why individuals were motivated to get the vaccine and the top reasons why they were hesitant. The most common reasons that participants were hesitant to get the vaccine were related to the vaccine's effectiveness and novelty, and fear of adverse effects. In contrast, the most frequent reasons that participants were motivated to get the vaccine were to protect others, to protect self, and to return to a sense of normalcy. The researchers found that anxious and non-anxious participants did not differ in vaccine hesitancy. However, discomfort with uncertainty predicted greater vaccine hesitancy in non-anxious participants, and in both groups' vaccine hesitancy was predicted by individualistic worldviews, conspiracy beliefs, and a lack of trust in authority. Aliya McNeil, lead author of the study, said that the findings could suggest that people without anxiety disorders are concerned with uncertainty related to the vaccine itself, whereas people with anxiety disorders might view the vaccine as an opportunity to reduce stress and uncertainty related to the virus. This may indicate that vaccine hesitancy is related to how one values independence. The researchers hope that their findings will help aid in future research that continues to explore vaccine hesitancy and interventions to promote vaccine uptake.\ntribuneindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/anxiety-disorder-has-no-effect-on-vaccine-hesitancy-study/","tags":[],"title":"Anxiety disorder has no effect on vaccine hesitancy: Study"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Sunrise by window, Sunday brunch with her gang, here\u0026rsquo;s how Malaika Arora celebrated 48th birthday ANI Mumbai, October 24 Actor Malaika Arora turned 49 on Sunday.

Amid huge anticipation, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson starrer Black Adam was released in cinema halls in the country on October 20. The movie has already become Johnson's highest opener till now in the domestic market in the USA and had managed to get a decent opening in India as well. With a four-day weekend at hand, let's see how the latest Hollywood movie performed at the box office on the first weekend in India and how things are looking for it going ahead. Black Adam has been doing good business in Mumbai, Delhi and Southern states. Its collections in the first two days were well over Rs 11 crore. However, the earnings took a hit on Saturday and Sunday because of pre-Diwali festivities and the India Vs Pakistan T20 World Cup match. The film's collections in the northern region have been particularly lower because the Diwali fever is high. However, despite challenges, the film has managed to do business of well over Rs 23 crore in the first four days. Black Adam will be challenged by the Bollywood releases Ram Setu and Thank God from October 25 onwards. The new films have been eyed by the fans for the longest time and given the appeal of lead stars, and Ajay Devgn respectively, and the genre of the films, Black Adam will face stiff competition from October 25 onwards when the latest releases hit the big screens. Black Adam did business of USD 140 million worldwide in the opening weekend. The movie has been getting mixed reviews from critics but Johnson's appeal and the pull for the family audience have been witnessed globally. The movie performed especially well in markets where DC excels, including Latin America and parts of South East Asia, reported Deadline.\nindiatvnews\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/black-adam-box-office-dwayne-johnson-starrer-earns-this-much-in-india-in-1/","tags":[],"title":"Black Adam Box Office: Dwayne Johnson starrer earns this much in India in 1st weekend"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Hong Kong Presents Digital Currency Prototype, Project Aurum Financial authorities in Hong Kong have unveiled a prototype of the Chinese autonomous territory’s own central bank digital currency called Project Aurum.

The two-tier platform features a wholesale interbank and a retail e-wallet system, participants revealed. Hong Kong to Issue Retail Tokens and Stablecoins as Part of Project Aurum A collaboration between the BIS Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute has produced a prototype of Hong Kong’s upcoming digital currency, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) announced. Project Aurum is a full-stack, front-end and back-end, central bank digital currency (CBDC) system comprising a wholesale interbank system and a retail e-wallet system, the international financial institution explained in a press release this week. Participants in Aurum want to launch two different types of digital tokens. The first kind will be an intermediated digital currency while the second one will be a CBDC-backed stablecoin circulated in the interbank system. The BIS remarked: The latter is unique in the study of CBDC to date. Privacy, safety and flexibility are core to the system. “Bringing CBDC-backed stablecoins to life has never been done before and we, therefore, felt that doing so may supplement the growing body of research on private sector stablecoins,” the project’s authors elaborate. They further explain that in contrast with private stablecoins, Aurum’s stablecoin balances are reconciled, versus real-time gross settlement balances of the issuing bank with the central bank. The developers believe that the system of CBDC-backed stablecoins can be used by monetary authorities when they try to work out the regulatory approaches in regard to private sector stablecoins, “especially while seeking to design methods to verify the backing of the stablecoins, a highly topical matter.” Just like with its fiat currency, three of Hong Kong’s financial institutions will be authorized to issue state-backed digital coins. Hong Kong, one of the world’s major financial centers, has been intensifying efforts to catch up with others on the CBDC development front, including mainland China which has been expanding the digital yuan (e-CNY) pilot. The Chinese special administrative region started exploring the issuance of its own CBDC in March 2021. In September of this year, the HKMA said that it was preparing to trial a digital version of the Hong Kong dollar (e-HKD) in the coming months. The monetary authority also took part in trials of cross-border CBDC transactions with the People’s Bank of China and the central banks of Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.

(Bloomberg) -- Rishi Sunak took a huge step toward becoming the UK’s next prime minister as former premier Boris Johnson pulled out of the contest after a weekend of vacillation and as he won the endorsement of Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt. In a brief statement on Twitter late Sunday -- shortly after Johnson said he wouldn’t stand for fear of dividing the Conservative Party -- Sunak vowed to lead with “integrity, professionalism and accountability” if he won the race for No. 10 Downing Street. Johnson’s decision, days after he cut short a Caribbean holiday to get his political campaign going, leaves Sunak facing House of Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt in what is now a two-person race. Sunak, a former chancellor whose resignation in July led to Johnson’s ultimate downfall, gained the public support of several key ministers on Sunday including Grant Shapps and -- on the Tory right -- Suella Braverman. Sunak has at least 123 lawmakers behind him, compared to Johnson’s 51 named backers, according to Bloomberg’s tally, which counts only 23 for Mordaunt. In his statement, Johnson said he had the support of at least 102 MPs, enough to have taken the contest to a ballot of party members who have sided with Johnson in the past. The issue now is how many of Johnson’s camp, including Brexit hardliners such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, will throw their lot in with Mordaunt and ensure the race continues beyond Monday. According to odds at political betting site Smarkets, Sunak is a near certainty to become Britain’s fourth prime minister in three years. But whoever wins faces the task of trying to bring unity to a party that has been through months of upheaval and bruising public infighting. Conservative support has fallen well behind the Labour opposition in polls as a brutal cost-of-living squeeze and soaring inflation darkens the economic outlook. The pound extended gains after Johnson said he wouldn’t stand, rallying as much as 1.0% to $1.1401 in Asia on expectations that a potential Sunak premiership would be better qualified at trying to fix the nation’s finances. Sunak will “turn the page on what went wrong, take decisions in the national interest and rebuild the extraordinary potential of our economy,” Hunt said in a column for the Telegraph late Sunday. It was Prime Minister Liz Truss’s decision to step down that triggered the contest, following weeks of turmoil with investors jettisoning UK assets. Her economic plan, including a big boost in borrowing to pay for tax cuts, rattled markets and turned voter sentiment further against the Tories. The possibility that Johnson could return to office after leaving less than two months ago was the latest twist in the upheaval of British politics that followed the 2016 vote to leave the European Union. Johnson, whose ability to cut through to the broad electorate helped the Conservatives to a landslide win in the 2019 general election, had to step down after a series of scandals rocked his premiership. His political career appeared all but over until Truss’s administration imploded. After Mordaunt declared her candidacy on Friday, and Sunak did likewise on Sunday, the pressure was mounting on Johnson’s camp. But after trying to broker deals separately with Sunak and Mordaunt, Johnson realized that even if he did win the support of party members, he’d struggle to run operations from Downing Street with a fractured and rebellious parliamentary party questioning his decisions. While he remains popular with Tory members, MPs are divided about his legacy and worried that returning him to office would revive all the scandals that bought him down. “You can’t govern effectively unless you have a united party in Parliament,” Johnson wrote in his statement. “There is a very good chance that I would be successful in the election with Conservative party members. But in the course of the last days I have sadly come to the conclusion that this would simply not be the right thing to do.” The party set a deadline of 2 p.m. Monday for contenders to certify the support of at least 100 MPs each to go forward to a ballot. If there’s more than one candidate running by the end of Monday, party members will have the final say in an online vote, with a result due on Friday. Johnson didn’t endorse anyone, saying he’d support whoever wins. While Sunak has a commanding lead, his coronation isn’t necessarily clear cut and there are some scenarios where Mordaunt could emerge as the favorite of Tory members. Earlier in the summer, he lost to Truss in the leadership battle to replace Johnson, with Tory members concerned about his role in Johnson’s downfall and his decision to raise taxes to the highest level since World War II. There’s also unease about his personal wealth and his aggressive attacks on Truss during that contest. Mordaunt’s star is rising and she has a more informal tone that jibes better with the electorate than Sunak’s more polished image. She served as trade secretary before being promoted to lead the House of Commons, while her confident performances in the lower house and optimistic outlook generated talk she could help Conservatives move beyond Johnson-Sunak controversies. In the contest that installed Truss as premier, Mordaunt placed second to Sunak -- and ahead of Truss -- in every round of voting among her MP colleagues until the critical one. In July, a ConservativeHome website survey of party members ranked Mordaunt second behind Defense Secretary Ben Wallace on who should be leader. Those factors may encourage Mordaunt’s reluctance to step aside. Growth and Prosperity In a column for the Telegraph newspaper, Mordaunt wrote she’d focus on cutting taxes and raising productivity to “deliver growth and prosperity” across the nation, a pitch similar to what Truss offered. “I understand the challenges families are facing, and I know how difficult things are when household budgets are squeezed, the cost of living goes up and public services just don’t seem to be there,” Mordaunt wrote. But Tory leaders are concerned at the growing economic crisis starting to engulf the country. A closely-watched survey due Monday morning is likely to show a recession is deepening as inflation lingers at its highest level in 40 years. A burgeoning budget deficit has left Hunt warning about difficult decisions ahead. He’s due to deliver a major statement on the Treasury’s tax-and-spending plans on Oct. 31, a date picked to better inform the Bank of England on how quickly it raises interest rates.

The United States (US) has recorded more than 15 million pediatric COVID-19 cases until September 2022, and pediatric patients account for about 18% of US COVID-19 cases. Notably, during the Omicron wave, children younger than six months accounted for 44% of the overall COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among those under four. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been effective, particularly against the Delta variant. However, they were less effective against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron. Since infants younger than six months are ineligible for COVID-19 vaccination, they are reliant on the immunity acquired placentally from their mothers. Nevertheless, vaccination during pregnancy is thought to protect infants against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, recent studies reported that maternal vaccination was linked to a lower risk of infection and hospitalization in infants in their first four and five months. ​​​​​​​ Study: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination and Infant Protection Against SARS-CoV-2 During the First 6 Months of Life . ​​​​​​​Image Credit: Marina Demidiuk / Shutterstock In the present study, researchers assessed the effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination during pregnancy against infection of infants with SARS-CoV-2. The study was conducted on infants born from December 15, 2020, to May 31, 2022, at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated healthcare delivery organization providing comprehensive access to healthcare to members. Infants were excluded if they did not become KPNC members within two months of birth or were born to mothers who 1) did not have primary KPNC facility assignment, 2) were not 16-50 years old, 3) tested SARS-CoV-2-positive before pregnancy, 4) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before pregnancy, 5) were vaccinated before pregnancy, 6) received vaccines other than mRNA vaccines, and 7) were not continuous members of KPNC. The study’s outcomes were the first positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result and hospitalization of infants within six months of life. In addition, electronic health records (EHRs) of mothers were accessed to obtain information on covariates such as age, race/ethnicity, the primary KPNC facility, neighborhood deprivation index (NDI), insurance payor, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), diabetes status, hypertension, and parity. The authors used Cox proportional hazards to compute the hazard ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection between infants born to vaccinated and non-vaccinated mothers. Infants were followed up from birth to their first positive test. Additionally, secondary analyses, implemented as a test-negative design, were conducted by restricting the population to infants tested for SARS-CoV-2 at least once. The researchers identified more than 62,000 infants born at KPNC facilities; after exclusions, 30,288 infants were included for analysis. Most mothers (66.15%) were aged 25 – 35 years and White (37.57%), followed by Asians (27.26), Hispanics (24.45%), and Black (5.16%). Mothers of 19,179 infants (63.32%) were not vaccinated during pregnancy; 3.42% of mothers received one dose of mRNA vaccine, 31.22% received two doses, and 2% received three doses during pregnancy. In the first six months of life, 3.1% of infants tested SARS-CoV-2-positive, and 10 had to hospitalize. The crude incidence of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was lower among infants born to double-vaccinated mothers than those with non-vaccinated mothers during the Delta wave. After adjusting for covariates, maternal vaccination during pregnancy was significantly associated with a lower risk of infants testing positive by 85% and 57% during the first two and six months (of life), respectively. During the Omicron wave, maternal vaccination decreased the risk of infants testing positive by 22% and 12% in the first two and six months, respectively. The overall crude hospitalization rate of infants in their first six months was low for those born to double-vaccinated mothers. Only one infant of a vaccinated mother was hospitalized, while the remaining (hospitalized) infants had non-vaccinated mothers. Secondary analysis indicated that maternal vaccination reduced infant test positivity by 63% and 40% in the first six months of life, during Delta and Omicron waves, respectively. In summary, the researchers observed that two mRNA vaccine doses administered during pregnancy were associated with a reduced risk of infants testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their first six months. Protection declined with the age of infants. Maternal vaccination was less effective during the Omicron period. Although vaccination efficacy against infant hospitalization was not assessed due to the small sample, mothers of nine hospitalized infants were not vaccinated, suggesting that maternal vaccination may protect infants from hospitalization.

According to data from The Office of National Coordinator For Health Information Technology, 76% percent of US providers are using an EHR system since 2014. The report also found that more than 50 million people were enrolled in LEM insurance plans during this period, with many choosing not to hold Medicare or Medicaid benefits because they could purchase private insurance through insurers who took these low-income earners cost-effectively. Digitizing data is the key to more efficient patient treatment. A lot of people are looking at how EHR software can streamline medical practices and cut down on costs, which will ultimately benefit patients as well. What is EHR software? Healthcare providers and patients alike can access all patient information with an electronic health record system. This provides for better quality treatment and instant recall at any time during your day or night if needed. For a better understanding of what EHR software consists of, let’s consider its core features: Health information databases are crucial for making treatment decisions regarding diagnosis, allergies, and more. They store clinical data, such as lab test results or medications, which can be accessed using an electronic format. The result management system allows physicians to quickly access and manage test results, providing unparalleled efficiency for busy practices. The order feature helps to reduce medical errors by providing electronic processing of orders and prescriptions. This patient support feature gives patients access to their health records, which can help them carry out at-home monitoring. Now let’s take a closer look at what advantages EHR systems can provide. Reducing medical errors Medical errors are a severe problem in the United States, and according to Martin Makary and Michael Daniel, there is an annual death toll of more than 250 thousand due to them. Data-driven healthcare is the future of personalized care. EHR software helps doctors make better diagnoses and preventive measures. At the same time, digital records keep track of everything from weight loss plans to cholesterol levels in real time so patients can stay healthier for longer. EHR systems have revolutionized the healthcare industry by eliminating tedious data entry requirements, allowing doctors to spend more time on patient care and accuracy. The use of an electronic health record (EHR) is associated with greater efficiency in diagnosis as it provides reliable access for complete past medical history from one place; this allows practitioners more efficient treatment and better outcomes than those achieved through penmanship notes taken at each visit. Increased quality of care The findings from this survey show that 75% of US doctors believe EHR software has allowed them to provide better patient care. As for the patients, 85 percent think digital records will significantly improve their quality. The use of EHRs can improve the quality and accessibility for patients by providing accurate information about lab results, and insurance coverage and making treatment recommendations accessible. Now let’s look in detail at what exactly an EHR does to achieve better care: With an EHR, doctors are able to quickly and accurately diagnose patients. They have access to patient data and treatments that have been attempted before for accurate diagnoses of what might be wrong with you. With e-prescribing, patients can receive prescriptions in an easy-to-read digital format and avoid the hassle of indecipherable handwriting.EHRs have made it possible for physicians to receive instant notifications about their patients’ test results, which can be crucial in making timely decisions. Patients will also benefit from this service because they’ll never miss another appointment or forget anything important.Computer-aided diagnosis is becoming more and more popular, with software algorithms being used to improve the detection of visual abnormalities like lung nodules or pigmented skin lesions. The power of (big) data With the help of EHRs, physicians can make better treatment decisions. The system brings together all available information on one page – it’s like having your google search bar at home. It’s no surprise that patients are eager to have their data collected so they can receive higher-quality care. Medical technology has evolved, and with it comes more options for how we monitor the health of individuals in order to make better treatment decisions based on what is needed at any given time during an individual’s life cycle – from newborns right up until death itself. The powerful advantages of EHR predictive analytics are demonstrated in the case study at Kaiser Permanente. Their own algorithm helped them precisely predict which newborns would need treatment for infection, and they were able to save 250K babies from unnecessary antibiotics by using this information. As we can see from these examples (and many more), successful use cases such as those featured here provide compelling proof that AI is not only possible but necessary when solving problems with high stakes environments like healthcare or law enforcement- where lives depend on accurate outcomes; If you’re looking into implementing any form of machine learning within your team’s workflow – do some research first. Streamlined workflow The implementation of an EHR system has been shown to improve patient care and speed up documentation processes. One healthcare provider who successfully implemented this software saw their speeds for processing paperwork increase by nearly 17%. The full potential of EHR solutions is only unlocked when healthcare providers take advantage and leverage their investments in the technology With EHR, medical staff can focus on what they do best. Paperwork is avoided and all costs of transcription are eliminated by using an electronic health record which saves time for doctors’ offices as well.With EHR solutions, doctors can create notes twice as fast by using templates. For instance, when a patient fully recovers from an illness or injury and their condition is stable enough for them not to need further care in the hospital room – which means less time spent dealing with charts and paperwork on top of everything else- medical staff will be able to save themselves hours every day.With EHR software, doctors can communicate with one another about a patient’s care and share information. Thanks to the robust coordination of treatment plans by medical staff members this will eliminate unnecessary treatments as well as remove some burden from them.With EHR, medical providers can easily find comprehensive files containing all patient treatment data. This is beneficial for both the provider and patient as it enables them to have access not only their current care but also any past treatments they may need in order to get better faster. The future of healthcare may be in EHR software, which can help providers save money and improve patient care by automating basic tasks. This technology also has many other benefits for doctors’ offices including increased revenue due to reduced risk factors associated with medical mistakes.

Study: Impact of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 and its variant polymorphisms on host responses and viral pathogenesis . Image Credit: ktsdesign / Shutterstock The host's innate immune response is the first line of defense against all pathogenic infections. Several studies have highlighted the importance of type I interferon (IFN) response in defending against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Any congenital disorder affecting the IFN pathway makes one susceptible to lethal pathogenic infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Perhaps, this is why some severely ill COVID-19 patients have neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFN. While the determinants for COVID-19 outcome are not understood completely, the inability to mount a timely and effective antiviral IFN response promotes SARS-CoV-2 persistence and tissue damage, contributing to COVID-19 severity. In addition, studies have also shown the role of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins in inhibiting innate immune activation. The researchers of the current study, thus, focused on SARS-CoV-2 ORF6, an accessory SARS-CoV-2 protein. In the present study, researchers used biochemical and molecular methods, combined with in vivo animal studies, to dissect the impact of the innate immune antagonist ORF6 on the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, they functionally characterized the ORF6 D61L mutation common between Omicron BA.2 and BA.4 sub-variants. The team first transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 and an empty vector. Next, they checked for the intracellular distribution of bulk poly (A) RNA levels by fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH). This helped the researchers evaluate whether the ORF6-Nup98/Rae1 interaction could contribute to the inhibition of host mRNA nuclear export. Further, the researchers hypothesized that ORF6 could modulate SARS-CoV-2 gene expression. So they first quantified the differences in protein levels between rSARS-CoV-2 wild-type and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 ∆ORF6 infected cells using global abundance proteomics. Furthermore, they investigated whether ORF6 modulated this protein expression at a transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. For in vivo studies, the team infected eight-week-old female hamsters with 5x10 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of either the parental rSARS-CoV-2 WT or the ORF6-deficient virus. They recorded weight loss in all animals from the day of infection to 15 days post-infection (dpi). Then, they sacrificed these animals at 2, 4, and 6 dpi to harvest their lungs and nasal turbinates to determine viral titer and histopathological evaluations. ORF6 directly interacts with the nucleoporin 98 (Nup98)-ribonucleic acid export 1 (Rae1) complex at the nuclear pore, disrupting bidirectional nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking in two distinct ways. The first method involved selective inhibition of karyopherin-mediated nuclear import pathways, including signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2 by ORF6. Additionally, it prevented nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) p65. The second method involved modulation of host cell messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) export, where ORF6 facilitated the preferential translation of SARS-CoV-2 viral transcripts and prevented host antiviral responses. The D61 residue in the ORF is located close to the M58 residue at the C-terminal tail (CTT) of the protein that directly binds to the RNA binding pocket of the Nup98-Rae1 complex. This mutation, shared by the Omicron variants BA.2 and BA.4, influenced ORF6's ability to block host mRNA export. This phenomenon has important implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and pathogenicity. Furthermore, the authors noted that SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) inhibited host mRNA export. A better understanding of how ORF6 and NSP1 complement each other functionally during SARS-CoV-2 infection will be crucial to uncover molecular mechanisms governing the innate immune antagonism of these viral proteins. Regarding in vivo effects of ORF6, the authors noted that hamsters infected with an ORF6 deleted SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses suffered minimal weight loss and reduced lung injury and type 2 alveolar (AT2) cells' hyperplasia. These findings pointed to an increased STAT1 translocation and interferon-stimulating genes (ISG) expression in the lungs. Surprisingly, this did not markedly reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in the respiratory tract of infected hamsters. One explanation is that this experimental model could not detect the in vivo impact of ORF6 on SARS-CoV-2 replication, which was inherently subtle. It might also be due to the circulation and transmission of Omicron BA.2 and BA.4 variants containing a deleterious ORF6 polymorphism in humans. The study results also uncovered a previously unobserved role of ORF6 in the modulation of SARS-CoV-2 protein expression. The researchers observed that the expression of several ORF1- and subgenomic RNA-derived SARS-CoV-2 proteins were altered in cells infected with an ORF6-deficient SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to favor the expression of structural and accessory viral genes. The study results identified ORF6 as a key SARS-CoV-2 innate immune antagonist. The ORF6 loss-of-function mutations markedly attenuated the host antiviral responses to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo in the hamster model. Furthermore, the study highlighted the importance of genomic surveillance and variant analysis to understand the mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion strategies. bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.\nnews-medical\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/research-suggests-that-orf6-is-a-major-sars-cov-2-innate-immune-antagonist/","tags":[],"title":"Research suggests that ORF6 is a major SARS-CoV-2 innate immune antagonist"},{"categories":["health"],"contents":"United Nations Day: आज है यूनाइटेड नेशंस डे, जानें क्या है इस बार की थीम और इसकी हिस्ट्री United Nations day-October 24- हर साल 24 अक्टूबर को यूनाइटेड नेशंस डे मनाया जाता है और इस दिन ही यूनाइटेड नेशन को ऑफिशियल रूप से स्थापित किया गया था. 2022 में यूनाइटेड नेशन को काम करते हुए पूरे 77 साल पूरे हो जाएंगे.\nhindinews18\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/united-nations-day-/","tags":["लाइफ़"],"title":"United Nations Day: आज है यूनाइटेड नेशंस डे, जानें क्या है इस बार की थीम और इसकी हिस्ट्री"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Coimbatore cylinder blast' shows state intelligence failure: TN BJP chief Questioning the DMK govt for state intelligence failure as Coimbatore Cylinder blast, Tamil Nadu BJP President K Annamalai claimed that it was a terror attack with ISIS link\nQuestioning the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government for state intelligence failure as Coimbatore Cylinder blast, Tamil Nadu Bharatiya Janata Party President K Annamalai claimed that it was a terror attack with ISIS link.

In a dig, Thackeray said there is a downpour of announcements under the Eknath Shinde government and a \"drought\" in their implementation as he interacted with rain-hit farmers in Aurangabad district. He said the incumbent government loved to organise celebrations without bothering to see if people are happy and satisfied. The former chief minister was talking to reporters after visiting Pandharpur and Dahegaon villages in the Aurangabad district where retreating rain damaged crops. \"This state government is a celebration-loving government. There is an excess downpour of the announcement, whereas there is a drought in their implementation. Events should be celebrated but the government should see the people in the state are at least satisfied,\" he said. Thackeray said the state government must take efforts to change the relief criteria set by the National Disaster Response Fund as they have become outdated. He also said the state government should follow up with the Centre on the implementation of the 'Beed pattern' of crop insurance, also called the 80-110 formula. According to the supporters of the \"Beed pattern\", the formula gives benefits to farmers and the state by way of excess funds and to the insurer by capping the pay-outs. Calling his visit a symbolic one, Thackeray said the state government must declare \"wet drought\" in the state and provide Rs 50,000 per hectare as compensation to farmers affected by the rains. He said the state government must begin providing relief immediately instead of waiting for the loss assessment reports to be submitted from all areas. Speaking to PTI, farmer Kisanrao Dhonde (70) of Dahegaon in Gangapur tehsil said the heavy rains brought about by the retreating monsoons have destroyed his crops. \"My farm is spread over 6.5 acres. I had sown corn and cotton and harvest time was nearing. I had taken a loan of Rs one lakh to cover the cost of production. Now I won't even 30 per cent of this amount from the sale of whatever produce is left,\" he said. Dhonde, whose farm was visited by Thackeray, said his brinjal and okra cultivation has also rotted, leaving his family with a debt of Rs 3 lakh. \"I have no money to make repayments. The state government must help us,\" he said. Dahegaon sarpanch Vikram Raut said loss assessment surveys have not been completed as yet in the area and no aid from the government has reached people in the village so far. The Maharashtra cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to waive crop loans of a total of Rs 964.15 crore taken by farmers from land development banks. The assets and properties of land development banks will be transferred to the state government. The erstwhile Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by Thackeray in 2019 announced that those farmers who repay the crop loan on time will get an incentive. Initially, the amount was Rs 25,000, which was later revised to Rs 50,000. Now in opposition, Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress are demanding a declaration of wet drought in the state in the wake of retreating rain damaging crops of farmers.

Addressing the gathering, the Chief Minister said, \"Deepotsav of Ayodhya was started six years ago under the guidance and inspiration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . This festival of Uttar Pradesh has today become a festival of the country. A grand celebration of the sixth edition of Deepotsav is being held in Ayodhya, which is touching 'new heights of success.\" \"A city, which Lord Shri Ram himself has called 'glorious' (Janmabhoomi Mam Puri Suhavani, Uttar Dish Bah Saryu Pavni)', can never remain abandoned for so long. Deepotsav is now recognized as a significant celebration honoring the resolve of Ram Rajya\", he added. Prior to the Deepotsav event on Ram Ki Paidi, the symbolic coronation program of Lord Shri Ram was organized in Ramkatha Park, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Governor Anandiben Patel, both the Deputy Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh Brajesh Pathak and Keshav Prasad Maurya along with officials of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teeth Kshetra Trust and a large number of saints. \"Today, the entire city of Ayodhya is celebrating the arrival of Lord Shri Ram as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has realized the dream of Ramrajya in India through his resolve for the all-round development of the country and its people,\" CM Yogi said.

The CM recited couplets of Goswami Tulsidas, \"Daihik Daivik Bhautik Taapa, Ramraj Naahi Kaahun Vyapa\", which means in the kingdom of Rama, there was no disease, no divine wrath, and no calamity. The Chief Minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a politician who has imbibed the ideals of Maryada Purushottam Lord Shri Ram and has been working dedicatedly for the last eight and a half years to realize the vision of Ram Rajya in the country. \"During the pandemic, the 135 crore Indians received free treatment, free vaccine, and free test while free ration was provided to 80 crore people without any discrimination. The schemes of the government are reaching every section of society including housing, toilets, electricity connections, and the Ayushman Bharat yojana among others.

The CM went on to say that India has witnessed massive infrastructure growth under the leadership and guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Yogi Adityanath said, \"The double-engine government is working for the welfare of every section without discrimination.\" The Chief Minister added, \"Today, a grand Shri Ram temple is being constructed in Ayodhya, as well as the grand Dham of Lord Vishwanath has been built in Kashi. The rejuvenation work of the 'Char Dhams' of Uttarakhand being carried out gives a feeling of pride to every Indian.\" He further remarked, \"Today the revival of Vindhyavasini Dham through the construction of a corridor is going on a war footing. Ramayana circuit, Krishna circuit, Buddhist circuit, or restoration work of Shakti Peethas across the country is going on under the leadership of PM. All these are attempts to honor India's rich heritage.\" The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is aiming to advance India's development in line with Lord Shri Ram's objectives, he concluded.

During India's chase of 160, the Men in Blue had a poor start, losing four wickets for just 30 runs. The last time India played Pakistan in the T20 World Cup, which was last year in Dubai, the Indians ended up in the losing side, which was their first-ever defeat to these opponents in a World Cup game. Therefore, there was a sigh of relief on Kohli and Co's faces on Sunday when Ravichandran Ashwin hit the winning runs. \"It's a surreal atmosphere, I have no words, no idea how that happened. I am really lost for words. Hardik believed we can do it, if we stayed till the end. When Shaheen bowled from the pavilion end, that's when we decided to take him down.

It was the highest partnership for India against Pakistan for any wicket in T20Is.\"From 28 in 8, it came down to 16 to 6. I tried to stick to my instincts. The first one was the back of a hand slower ball (the one over long-on). Standing here I just feel like it was meant to be. Till today Mohali was my best innings against Australia. Today I will count this one higher. Hardik kept pushing me. The crowd has been phenomenal. You guys (fans) kept backing me and I am grateful for your support,\" added Kohli. Meanwhile, with his latest knock, Kohli also surpassed Rohit Sharma in the list of most runs in T20Is. Kohli is the leading run-scorer in the shortest format on the international level with 3,794 runs in 110 games at a strike rate of 138.41 and an average of 51.97.

The recent development around Charles Barkley’s contract with TNT provided a sigh of relief for fans of the award-winning show Inside the NBA. Earlier this year, the former MVP had caused quite a storm with rumors of him holding talks with LIV Golf, who reportedly offered him a fortune. An avid golfer, Barkley maintained that for him to leave TNT, he’d expect a ridiculous offer numbers-wise. Fortunately, for fans of Inside the NBA, The Chuckster wasn’t made a formal offer. Not wanting to keep Turner in limbo, the 59-year-old signed a massive deal with the network. The way the deal is structured, if TNT retains the rights to the NBA, Barkley’s deal goes for another 7 years.https://t.co/Kq3hESbyMU — Andrew Marchand (@AndrewMarchand) October 17, 2022 A 10-year contract meant Chuck wasn’t going anytime soon, given he had in the past voiced his desire to retire from the show once his two-year contract expired. “We’re all a big family — Ernie, Kenny and Shaquille are brothers to me — and I wouldn’t still be here if it wasn’t for them and all the amazing people who work on our show,” Barkley told New York Post. “I’m not gonna lie, though, this is a life-altering deal … and I’m blessed to be able to do live television for a living.” Also read: “Just Wait Until This Guy Finds Out About Stand Up Comedy”: NBA Twitter Reacts to Charles Barkley’s 10-year Contract with TNT During a recent appearance on the Dan Patrick Show, Barkley would at length discuss his new contract with TNT.

When asked if the LIV Golf negotiations affect his contract with TNT, Barkley answered, “Zero Percent.” “TNT asked me, we need something from you, would you give us something and I said, ‘what do you want?’ they’re like we need you to stay longer, we can’t lose you, and be it on the NBA.” Barkley revealed the producers wanted him to stay for at least 3-years and that they were going to bid on the NBA. When asked if he could sign for a couple of more years, the veteran forward said the following. “Well you guys have been great to me, I’ll stay on a couple of more years, and I mean there’s probably zero chance, I’m gonna stay for the entire 10 years.” Speaking about his meeting with Turner, The $60 million worth Barkley said “I met with Turner personally, I’m not worried about money at this stage of my life. Listen, if I don’t have money by now, I’m a big idiot. I mean, I played 16 years in the NBA, and this is my 22nd year starting the night on Turner.” Whatever may be the case, this serves as great news for fans of Inside the NBA, given the show would never be the same without him. Charles Barkley is a laugh riot. Sir Charles is one of the most entertaining personalities in the history of American sports broadcasting. Every word that the TNT analyst says on-air can constitute promo shots. The Alabama native has changed the landscape of sports broadcasting with his bold nature.

We were in no position to win this. The way we won that's more pleasing for us. Hats off to Virat for the way he batted, has to be the best innings he has played for India. I would like to thank everyone, it's wonderful to see. Their support for us is very, very crucial wherever we go,\" added Rohit.https://twitter.com/imVkohli/status/1584170142254084098 Even Pakistan skipper Babar Azam hailed Kohli. \"Our bowlers bowled really well. All credit to Kohli and Pandya. It wasn't easy with the new ball. We had partnerships after 10 overs. We had a chance. We tried to stick to our plans. But credit to Virat Kohli. In the middle we decided we wanted a wicket and held the spinner back. We had a lot of positives. The way Iftikhar played and the way Shan played,\" said Babar. India's next game is on Thursday (Oct. 27) against Netherlands at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). On the same day, Pakistan are also in action as they are scheduled to lock horns with Zimbabwe at Perth Stadium.\nthehansindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/kohli-played-his-best-innings-for-india-says-rohit-after-4-wicket-win-ov/","tags":["Sports,Top Stories,Cricket"],"title":"Kohli played his 'best innings for India,' says Rohit after 4-wicket win over Pakistan"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"Apple iPhone owners report Face ID issues after iOS update, know more MacRumours claims that there were issues with resetting Face ID on Apple devices with iOS 15.7.1 update.\ndnaindia\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/apple-iphone-owners-report-face-id-issues-after-ios-update-know-more/","tags":["Technology"],"title":"Apple iPhone owners report Face ID issues after iOS update, know more"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Explained | CCI’s ₹1,300 crore fine on Google and how that will change Android smartphones How is the Alphabet owned company allegedly violating its position especially with regard to the Android mobile device ecosystem?

After some one-sided contests in the ‘Super 12’ stage of the ongoing T20 World Cup 2022, arch-rivals India and Pakistan gifted the fans with an absolute cracker of a contest which went down to the wire, with India sealing victory off the final Over of their chase by 4 wickets. As the tournament moves on with the ‘Super 12’ teams, South Africa will take on Zimbabwe in the third match of the ‘Super 12 Group 2’ on Monday, at the Blundstone Arena, in Hobart. Zimbabwe, on the back of couple of wins during the group/qualifying stage earlier, managed to make it through to the next round, with their batting allrounder Sikander Raza proving to be their match-winner on both these occasions. ALSO READ: Bangladesh versus Netherlands tomorrow’s Super 12 match pitch report However, apart from him and Craig Ervine, none of the other batters in their line-up have managed to impress so far, which might hurt them big time against a quality South African attack tomorrow. As for South Africa, who recently lost the three-match away T20I series against India, will for certain be the favourites to win tomorrow’s contest, with eyes on their pace bowling attack, at the fast, bouncy pitches Down Under. SA vs ZIM pitch report Blundstone Arena The Bellerive Oval or the Blundstone Arena at Hobart, has already hosted a few matches during the qualifying stage of the World Cup earlier. The Proteas pace battery might well dictate terms during the contest tomorrow, as the fast bowlers at this venue have scalped 31 wickets in this year’s World Cup so far, at a strike rate of 14.4 during the night matches. With overcast conditions also expected during match time, expect the pacers to make further inroads, thereby making it a bit challenging for the batters. The average score across the seven matches this World Cup so far at this venue, has been 153.4 runs, which might well turn out to be a match-winning total after batting first. “The surface seems to be true, it is a solid track. Sri Lanka would want to bat first. There will be a bit of bounce and spin, maybe 160 would be par. The game within the game would be how the teams play against the shorter boundary with the breeze,” remarked former Australian pacer Dirk Nannes about the pitch at this venue, during the previous match here between Ireland and Sri Lanka today.

In fact, maintaining your passwords and data is more vital than ever as we become a more tech-reliant society. Today, I’m going to show you how to manage your Google Passwords like a pro and why you may want to check in on them frequently. We may make this into a series in the future to show you how to manage your other online accounts to maintain your safety and privacy, but today, we’re going for the big one. Why it’s important Our society is ripe with people who would seek to take advantage of those who are less tech-literate or savvy about how online accounts and information work. Luckily, Google has created the Safer with Google initiative . Here, they teach you a ton of great tips and tricks and even give you the tools you need to stay safe as you and your family browse online. One specific area I want to highlight, of course, is your passwords. Google Passwords is a one-stop shop for adding, modifying and removing saved passwords for any website you visit in the Chrome browser. By visiting Google Passwords on the web, you can let Google automatically tell you what needs to be changed or fixed to make your accounts ironclad. How to perform a Password Checkup The Password Checkup tool can be launched using the blue button below. One you arrive at the destination, a blue “Check Passwords” button will be waiting for you. Clicking it will have several benefits! First and foremost, it will show you how many and which of your online accounts are utilizing “compromised” passwords. These are items you should consider changing the password for immediately as they have likely suffered from a data breach, where your personal information was stolen from that company by a third party or otherwise exposed publicly. You can also check for such breaches at haveibeenpwned . Launch Password Checkup Compromised Passwords As you can see, prior to cleaning all of this up, I had 49 compromised passwords! That’s pretty scary, but the truth is that data breaches happen practically every week nowadays, and it’s a risk of using digital services. That’s not to say it should be accepted, but you should check back on the Password Checkup tool frequently to watch for them. Pro Tip: You can install the Google Password Alert extension from the Chrome Web Store to be notified when entering your password on any website. This will allow you to determine whether or not your data is safe. Fair warning though, it’s super annoying when it redirects you each time you enter your password on sites you trust, but it can be turned off for that site pretty easily! Duplicate or shared passwords The next section on the checkup tool tells you how many passwords are being reused or shared across different online accounts. Ideally, every website you visit should use a completely unique and different password, and this is much easier when Chrome auto-fills across both the browser and mobile. However, the truth is that the cultural operation of passwords has been nearly entirely dependent on the human brain – the most fallible and weakest link in the chain. Social engineering relies on humans to slip up or to create patterns, and hackers take these opportunities to figure out what your password may be. In other words, if they discover your password for one site, they can almost be sure it’s your password for another site or many others. The screenshot above is a very old one, and I’ve had it saved for a while, so luckily, I’m not sharing the same password across 553 sites anymore. Instead, I let Chrome randomly generate secure passwords for each of them and also let it store them on my behalf. I recommend doing this to avoid patterns! Weak Passwords Lastly, the “Weak Passwords” section shows you how many and which of your online accounts is using a password that’s not as secure as it could be. Normally, having a password be at least 8 characters with a capital letter, lower case letters, numbers, symbols, and so on strengthens it and makes it harder for an opportunist to guess, even with tools like hash tables. Once again, if you’re having trouble coming up with unique passwords that meet these criteria, you can allow Chrome to auto-generate something for you that fits the bill. I can’t stress this enough! If you’re worried about not being able to sign in on another device, make sure that said device has your Google Account synchronizing to it so that your passwords will be detected and injected into form fields automatically! As Google seeks to kill the password entirely, this entire ordeal may not be necessary anymore, but passwords themselves are a product of a bygone era (or rather one that’s passing before our very eyes!) In due time, the word “password” will be a joke we tell our grandkids, but the idea of safety and online security with privacy tools that account protection will never be a thing of the past. Change your passwords often The common consensus for how often you ought to freshen up your passwords and change them to something new is generally every three months. There may be circumstances like the aforementioned data breaches and so on that cause you to consider changing them even more frequently. If there is a data breach on a website and Google informs you, you should take time to change that account’s password immediately! My advice to you is to visit the Google Password Checkup tool once every two to three months and simply go through all three sections until the check marks are no longer red or yellow but green. If you’re not a fan of Google Passwords, then I recommend you use something like Dashlane, One Password, or Lastpass (but never lose your master password or you’ll lose access to all of the passwords in the vault!) Knowledge is half the battle My last word of wisdom to you is to avoid storing passwords for your bank, Google Account, or any other online presence you maintain on paper, in a Keep note, or another plain text editor, or really anywhere else. It may be more convenient, but it can be something you regret for a long time to come if you become a victim of cybercrime! You don’t have to be like me who creates all of his passwords in other languages, or like those super techy individuals who create randomized strings of characters and memorizes them, but by utilizing the tools at your disposal and keeping up with the technology, you can maintain a safe online presence for you and your family without also constantly dealing with the headache of them.

Naresh Patel, a local industrialist, runs the cash-rich Khodaldham Trust for the welfare of the community. Gujarat govt's pre-election Diwali gift: No fines on traffic violations for 7 daysThe meeting between Patel and PM Modi is said to be crucial, given that it comes ahead of the Gujarat polls, which are likely to be announced soon.All the political parties have been wooing Naresh Patel for at least a year now and the latter has had meetings at the highest level with the BJP, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), after he dropped hints of his inclination to join politics. After hectic parleys with all of them many times, Patel finally announced that he had dropped his idea of plunging into politics, as desired by the community leaders.But speculation has begun again after Patel met Modi in Delhi. Patel has claimed the meeting was only to invite the Prime Minister to Khodaldham on October 31 and unfurl the Patidar flag. He told reporters that it was a courtesy call and no politics was discussed. Still, BJP sources said, the meeting itself was adequate to inspire the party cadres.State BJP President CR Paatil, however, said the meeting would go a long way in strengthening the party's prospects in the coming elections.Ramesh Tilara, a trustee of Khodaldham Trust who accompanied Patel during his meeting with Modi, said it was “a goodwill visit” and to invite the prime minister to Khodaldham. Modi is yet to confirm his date, according to Tilara.Paatil also told reporters: \"BJP workers are themselves geared up, but when the chief of a prestigious social and religious institution like Khodaldham Trust meets the PM, it instills confidence among the BJP cadres that they will achieve the targets for the elections.”The opposition Congress party had also tried to woo Naresh Patel, and his latest meetings were with Gujarat Congress chief Jagdish Thakor and Rajya Sabha MP Shaktisinh Gohil, among others.\nfreepressjournal\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/gujarat-pm-narendra-modis-meet-with-patidar-leader-sets-tongues-wagging/","tags":["India","Topnews"],"title":"Gujarat: PM Narendra Modi’s meet with Patidar leader sets tongues wagging"},{"categories":["science"],"contents":"Space news weekly recap: Returning asteroid samples, birth of a black hole and more - The Indian Express Space news weekly recap: Returning asteroid samples, birth of a black hole and more The Indian Express\ngoogle\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/space-news-weekly-recap-returning-asteroid-samples-birth-of-a-black-hole-/","tags":[],"title":"Space news weekly recap: Returning asteroid samples, birth of a black hole and more - The Indian Express"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Kohli is one of the best chasers in the world: Rohit after Kohli’s 82 not out vs PAK Kohli is one of the best chasers in the world: Rohit after Kohli’s 82 not out vs PAK\nindiatoday\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/kohli-is-one-of-the-best-chasers-in-the-world-rohit-after-kohlis-82-not/","tags":[],"title":"Kohli is one of the best chasers in the world: Rohit after Kohli’s 82 not out vs PAK"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Jagan to launch third 800-MW unit of supercritical thermal power plant in Andhra Pradesh on October 27 The Chief Minister to also disburse non-fishermen package to the displaced people pending since former Chief Minister Rajasekhara Reddy’s term\nthehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/jagan-to-launch-third-800-mw-unit-of-supercritical-thermal-power-plant-in-a/","tags":[],"title":"Jagan to launch third 800-MW unit of supercritical thermal power plant in Andhra Pradesh on October 27"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Andhra Pradesh: Sankar Foundation to conduct mega eye camp to mark Swaroopanandendra Swami’s birthday on October 28 thehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/andhra-pradesh-sankar-foundation-to-conduct-mega-eye-camp-to-mark-swaroopa/","tags":[],"title":"Andhra Pradesh: Sankar Foundation to conduct mega eye camp to mark Swaroopanandendra Swami’s birthday on October 28"},{"categories":["entertainment"],"contents":"Anushka Sharma danced and screamed after India’s win over Pakistan, calls Virat Kohli ‘a wonderful man’ indianexpress\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/anushka-sharma-danced-and-screamed-after-indias-win-over-pakistan-calls/","tags":["Bollywood","Entertainment"],"title":"Anushka Sharma danced and screamed after India’s win over Pakistan, calls Virat Kohli ‘a wonderful man’"},{"categories":["top"],"contents":"Smart garbage monitoring app for Thrikkakara too thehindu\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/smart-garbage-monitoring-app-for-thrikkakara-too/","tags":[],"title":"Smart garbage monitoring app for Thrikkakara too"},{"categories":["sports"],"contents":"Southampton v Arsenal: Premier League – live Match at St Mary’s kicks off at 2pm BSTGet in touch with Gregg via email or on TwitterThe teams are out at St Mary’s on what has ended up being a lovely day for football after the torrential showers earlier.

Upon arrival, he opened the box only to know that he has received a box full of e-waste and old computer parts. Just like some of us, he had only seen such frauds happening on social media platforms but witnessed it in real for the first time. Flipkart Plus user gets a giant stone and e-waste when ordered a gaming laptop On October 15th, Chinmaya ordered a gaming laptop, the Asus TUF Gaming F15, for his friend since he had a Flipkart Plus membership. The product was delivered on October 20, seal-packed from the outside. It wasn’t an open-box delivery like some of the items on Flipkart, but the buyer did share an OTP with the delivery person since the box looked just fine. However, when the main Flipkart packaging was opened, the Asus box inside was tampered and the barcodes and product details were removed. When the box was opened, there was everything but a laptop. It had old computer parts and e-waste along with a stone, which was apparently kept to keep the box heavy. As soon as this was learned by the buyer, he raised a return request which wasn’t approved by the seller. When the matter was known by Flipkart, it contacted the seller, however, the seller responded that the product was intact. Now, the buyer, Chinmaya, is in hopes that Flipkart investigates the issue as soon as possible and returns or refunds him. “I reported the same to Flipkart on the same day with all the proofs. They answered me that they need some time to get back with solution. On 23rd October they emailed me that the seller rejected the return request and the product is not at all damaged during the transportation,” said the buyer Chinmaya. This isn’t the first time that such scams are happening. Recently, a person ordered a laptop from Flipkart in the Big Billion Days sale but he received a detergent soap.

The New Orleans Pelicans are one of the whole four teams remaining in the Western Conference yet to lose a game. While the likes of Brandon Ingram, Jonas Valancuinas, and CJ McCollum have been balling out, the return of Zion Williamson has been extremely crucial for Willie Green and co. After missing out on the entire 2021-2022 campaign due to a foot injury, the 22-year-old averaged 11.3/3.3/2.8 in the 2022 preseason. Looking fitter than ever before, “Zanos” has been extremely dominant in NOLA’s first two outings.

In the clash between two undefeated teams, the main question is, will Williamson take on the floor tonight? Zion Williamson will look to dominate against the Jazz The former Duke Blue Devil has been sensational in the wins against the Nets \u0026 the Hornets. On 19th October, the 1-time All-Star wrecked havoc in the paint and recorded a 25-point, 9-rebound performance. View this post on Instagram A post shared by New Orleans Pelicans (@pelicansnba) In the bout against the Charlotte-based franchise, the highflyer put up 16 points in 31 minutes. NOLA fans can expect Zion to be a focal point during the Pels-Hornets clash, as he is expected to suit up on Sunday night. Unlike Kira Lewis Jr. (Out), E.J. Liddell (Out), and Jaxson Hayes (Questionable), Zion isn’t mentioned on the team’s injury report. Can NOLA go 3-0? The Pelicans haven’t disappointed yet. In the first two clashes, Brandon Ingram and co. have not yet trailed at any point. In the last 25 years, the Pels are only the fifth team to do so. The Pelicans are the fifth team in the last 25 years not to trail at any point in their first two regular season games, per @ESPNStatsInfo. The other four teams: – 2011-12 Hawks – 2004-05 Jazz – 2004-05 Heat – 1997-98 Hawks — Andrew Lopez (@_Andrew_Lopez) October 22, 2022 The big four of the Pels have been sensational so far. Agreed two games is a small sample space, however, averaging 92 PPG out of NOLA’s 127, must be satisfactory for Willie Green. pic.twitter.com/aWl8NK9SRl — Andrew Lopez (@_Andrew_Lopez) October 22, 2022 To be honest, it’ll be pretty easy for JV and “Zanos” to dominate the paint and boards while going up against the likes of Lauri Markkanen and Kelly Olynyk. There is a huge possibility that we see the New Orleans-based franchise grab the win on Sunday.

Continue reading...\nP alms sweat, heartbeat quickens, muscles tense. Your skin prickles and stomach churns. When fear subsides, we can be left with feelings of pleasure. Is this just the relief of having survived – or is it something more? Fight or flight The amygdala , an almond-shaped bundle of neurons deep in the centre of the brain, controls the fear response. In a fearful situation, the amygdala stimulates the hypothalamus , which activates two systems in the body – the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal cortical system – causing a flash flood of hormones and triggering the fight-or-flight response. Adrenaline boosts the body’s alertness. It speeds up the heart rate and diverts blood from the core to the muscles needed for movement. Cortisol raises blood pressure . Blood vessels around the vital organs dilate, flooding them with oxygen and nutrients. Breathing quickens, delivering fresh oxygen to the brain, while levels of glucose in the blood spike , giving the body a quick energy boost – ready for action. “Although we have an understanding of some aspects of neural fear networks and how they coordinate behaviour, there are still many unknowns,” says Dr Charlotte Lawrenson, a neuroscientist at Bristol University. In early societies, fear-inducing tales were used to teach children about dangers they might encounter When we are exposed to sensory stimuli or an environment that is potentially threatening, she says, two pathways are activated in the brain. The first is fast. Information is transferred to the sensory thalamus and then to the amygdala, allowing for immediate action on the threatening stimuli. The second is a slower, indirect route. Information is sent from the thalamus to the cortex, the outermost layer of the brain, associated with consciousness, reasoning and memory. This analyses the threat and allows us to determine whether we are in real danger. “We do not know exactly where the feeling of fear occurs in the brain,” says Lawrenson, “but it is likely to be from the coordinated activation of a fear network involving multiple brain regions.” If the threat is determined to be real, other areas of the brain will be activated to initiate a whole-body response to the danger. This includes the periaqueductal grey, which coordinates the antinociceptive, autonomic and behavioural reactions to stress and injury, blocking the detection of pain by sensory neurons and kickstarting the involuntary physiological processes and responding action. “The memory of [the danger] will be transferred and stored in the hippocampus,” adds Lawrenson’s co-researcher, Dr Elena Paci, “so that we are able to remember and identify the threat at the next encounter.” A window on our collective fears Fear is an ancient emotion and scary stories are ingrained in human history. In early societies , fear-inducing tales were used to teach children about dangers they might encounter, such as wolves and other predators. Today, cinema offers a window into society’s collective fears. In the 1954 sci-fi film, Godzilla was created by nuclear radiation, revealing the shared anxiety about the second world war atomic attacks. Horror films have often featured technology – robots that revolt against their creator like the Westworld hosts, or murderous AI such as Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Skynet in The Terminator . In the late 1970s and the 1980s, Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger made their appearances alongside the emergence of the serial killer in the public consciousness . Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street. Photograph: Ronald Grant In March 2020, when the pandemic went into hyperdrive, downloads of the movie Contagion – about a deadly pandemic – surged. Why did people want to watch a horror film about something so real to them at that point in time? Prof Marc Malmdorf-Andersen and his colleagues think that horror films have learning potential for uncertainty management. Navigating an unpredictable world An associate professor at Denmark’s Aarhus University, Malmdorf-Andersen researches the cognitive processes involved in play and learning. “Spending time in these fictional realms can almost be thought of as an opportunity to draft up your own instruction book for worst-case scenarios,” he says. A study on horror fans during the Covid pandemic found that people who enjoyed watching scary films were more psychologically resilient than non-horror fans. “They have, in some ways, been exposed to similar scenarios and might use that experience for navigating new, uncertain realities,” says Malmdorf-Andersen. “It is possible that recreational forms of fear in general can help improve emotion regulation and coping skills.” Enjoyment of fear, says Malmdorf-Andersen, makes sense if you look at it as a “form of play”. “Enjoyment of scary stimuli seems to be related to getting a grip on unpredictable situations,” he says. “In much the same way, children’s play is characterised by seeking out moderate amounts of uncertainty, moderate surprises, in an effort to make sense of them.” In fact, researchers at Exeter University say that when children’s play involves risk and fear, it can function as a protective factor against anxiety . Play, says Malmdorf-Andersen, is a strategy for learning how to deal with unfamiliar situations and making the unpredictable predictable. The sweet spot To investigate the relationship between enjoyment and fear, Malmdorf-Andersen and his colleagues at Aarhus University’s Recreational Fear Lab studied a group of people who went to a haunted house visitor attraction. There, the guests voluntarily signed up to be terrified by brain-munching zombies, chainsaw-wielding maniacs and child-eating murderers. The researchers filmed the guests, monitored their heart rates and asked them how they felt at various points during the experience. “At Dystopia Haunted House there are about 70-100 scare actors each night,” says Malmdorf-Andersen, “and a large special-effects department. They challenge their guests on a lot of different levels – disgust, fear, jump scare, unease, being alone, being in the dark, claustrophobia…” The findings indicated that humans don’t enjoy being too far from their normal physiological state, but they do enjoy being just a little bit out of their comfort zone. “Our results suggest that there might be a ‘sweet spot’ between fear and enjoyment,” says Malmdorf-Andersen. “A just-right spot where the context is not too terrifying, but not too tame either. This sweet spot seems to be where enjoyment is maximised.” At that spot, a flood of fear quickly followed by relief results in the release of feelgood chemicals in the brain – endorphins and dopamine – rewarding you with a rush of euphoria. When fear goes too far However, it is important to keep in mind that everyone is different. We all have a unique sense of what we find scary – and it’s a fine line between harmless fun and genuine terror. Too much fear can lead to distress and dysfunction . Globally, about 275 million people suffer from anxiety disorders , which can become chronic and debilitating and affect a person’s life trajectory. “Different people have a different level of activation of certain areas [of the brain],” says Paci. What can be a thrill for one person can be truly terrifying for another. So dare to be scared this Halloween – but just the right amount.\ntheguardian\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/why-we-enjoy-fear-the-science-of-a-good-scare/","tags":["Psychology","Halloween","Neuroscience","Science"],"title":"Why we enjoy fear: the science of a good scare"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Gandhi family, its NGOs not above law: BJP on cancellation of FCRA licences The BJP on Sunday welcomed the cancellation of the FCRA licences of two NGOs headed by former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, and said the Gandhi family and organisations linked to them can't be above law.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government last month re-imposed a complete ban on the production, sale and use of all types of firecrackers till January 1, 2023, including on Diwali, a practice it has been following for the last two years.

Production, storage and sale of firecrackers in the capital will be punishable with a fine of up to Rs 5,000 and three years jail under Section 9B of the Explosives Act, Rai had said. Ahead of the Gujarat Assembly polls due later this year, AAP national convener Kejriwal has visited the state multiple times in the recent past to garner support for his party.

Some of the weather stations there have never recorded any rain in all of their years of operation.\nThe driest place on Earth is the Atacama desert, which is located along the western coast of South America's cone and stretches for about 1,600 kms. Some of the weather stations there have never recorded any rain in all of their years of operation. But it's far from lifeless; many species that are unique to this region and have adapted to its harsh conditions can be found here. Additionally, the Atacama hosts one of the most breathtaking natural phenomena on average once every five to ten years, from mid-September to mid-November: the \"desierto florido\" (literally, \"blooming desert\"). Following heavy rainfall earlier this year, one of these mass blooms, which is currently occurring in northern Atacama, is frequently covered by media from all over the world. However, what physiological and evolutionary processes allow for the enormous variety of flower colours, shapes, and visual patterns found in desiertos floridos? And how do pollinators, primarily hymenopterans like solitary wasps and bees in the Atacama, who are the beneficiaries of this visual extravaganza, perceive all this variety? A recent study published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution addresses this issue. \"Our aim was to shed light on the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that cause biological diversity in extreme environments like the Atacama desert,\" said first author Dr Jaime Martinez-Harms, a researcher at the Institute of Agricultural Research in La Cruz, Chile. \"Here we show that flowers of the pussypaw Cistanthe longiscapa, a representative species for desiertos floridos in the Atacama desert, are highly variable in the colour and patterns they present to pollinators. This variability probably results from different so-called 'betalain' pigments in the flower petals.\" Model species Late in 2021, a desierto Florido event was studied by Martnez-Harms and colleagues close to the northern Chilean city of Caldera. Even though it was smaller than the current event, satellites could clearly see it. A dominant species was the annual plant C. longiscapa (family Montiaceae), which bloomed in two distinct patches tens of kilometres apart and reached a height of 20 cm. To human eyes, these patches were composed of exclusively purple and yellow flowers. Numerous intermediate flowers of the same species--reddish, pinkish, and white--grew in between them, providing strong evidence that the purple and yellow morphs are heritable variations that are capable of interbreeding. Visualizing flowers as insects see them Insects, with their compound eyes and different sensitivities, see the world very differently than we do. For example, most hymenopterans have three types of photoreceptors, which are maximally sensitive to UV, blue, and green. Martinez-Harms et al used cameras sensitive to visible light and UV and spectrometers to measure the reflection, absorption, and transmission of different wavelengths by the petals of a total of 110 purple, yellow, red, pink, and white C. longiscapa flowers. This enabled them to produce composite images of these variants as seen by their many species of pollinators. Diversity hidden from human eyes The results show that just within this single plant species, the diversity perceptible to pollinators was greater than to us. For example, hymenopterans, just like us, can easily distinguish between red, purple, white, and yellow variants. But they can also distinguish between flowers with a high versus a low UV reflection among yellow and purple flowers. A UV 'bullseye pattern' at the heart of some flowers, which guides pollinators to the nectar and pollen, is invisible to us. An exception is UV-reflecting pink and reddish C. longiscapa, which are quite distinct to human eyes, but probably appear similar to hymenopterans. This visual diversity of C. longiscapa flowers is probably mainly due to differences between betalains - yellow, orange, and purple pigments that are a typical trait of the plant order Caryophyllales to which the pussypaws belong. Betalains don't just give colours to flowers: they also protect from drought, salt stress, and damage from reactive oxygen radicals under environmental stress - traits highly beneficial in deserts. Pollinators drive the selection of new variants The authors proposed that the observed standing diversity within C. longiscapa flowers is caused by variations in pollinator sensitivity to and preference for various colours and patterns--a current evolutionary experiment that largely goes unnoticed by humans. \"The great variation in flower colour within C. longiscapa can be explained if different species of pollinating insects, through their preference for particular flower colours and patterns, could cause these variants to become reproductively isolated from other individuals of the same plant species. This ongoing process could ultimately lead to the origin of new races or species,\" said Martinez-Harms. \"In our next studies, we will further investigate the chemical identity and the biological synthesis pathways of betalains and other flower pigments, as well as their relationship to traits such as the scents produced by the flowers. This should help us to understand their role in shaping the interactions between plants and their pollinators, and in the plants' tolerance to biotic and abiotic stressors under fluctuating climate conditions,\" said Martinez-Harms.

Things were smooth for Vijayan from 2016, when he first took over as the new chief minister and things remained the same even when Arif Mohammed Khan - a surprise choice by the national BJP leadership - was appointed the Governor in 2019. A seasoned politician, 70-year-old Khan who has travelled across quite a few political parties, starting from age 26, in a short time had won the hearts of many a Keralite through his affable and friendly approach and had no airs of the highly decorative post of his. But Khan first raised eyebrows when two years back he threatened not to read out adverse remarks about the Narendra Modi government, but later he changed his stand. From then on, it was a different Khan one saw, especially when it came to issues with the Vijayan government. He was at odds over the position taken by the Vijayan government on the Citizenship Amendment Act and from then on it was a series of tussles with Khan, giving headaches to the state government. He soon got the tag of being the principal 'opposition party' replacing the Congress led UDF. Then came the issue of the reappointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor Gopinath Ravindran and after coming down heavily on it, Khan quietly inked the reappointment. He then blew hot over the appointment of Priya Varghese, wife of Vijayan's private secretary K.K. Ragesh, to a teaching job in the same university and he put his foot down. When the Kerala High Court took a similar stand, it gave Khan an edge in his tiff with the Vijayan government. In between he made a scathing attack on the way personal staff members were appointed and even though he promised to take strict action, so far nothing has happened. And things got more bitter when he refused to ink the controversial tweaking of the Lok Ayukta Ordinance, forcing Vijayan to call a special sitting of the legislature. Khan is presently sitting on the Bill. If these issues were not enough, recently Khan dismissed 15 nominated senate members of Kerala University after they, despite being warned to be present at a crucial senate meeting, did not turn up. Khan also warned the state ministers not to speak disparagingly about him and threatened that it could lead to the withdrawal of his 'pleasure', clearly implying that if they continue in the same manner such ministers might be booted out. Vijayan however maintained a stoic silence, but came down heavily early his week when he said the rights, responsibilities and duties of the Governor are clearly mentioned in the Constitution as are those of the ministers. Even B. R. Ambedkar, the principal architect of India's Constitution, has said the powers of the Governor are very narrow and the apex court has also clarified that the Governor should work according to the directions of the cabinet. \"Everything is clearly written and when such a situation is there, can anyone say otherwise,\" added Vijayan. To a question on the way Khan dismissed 15 senate members of Kerala University, he said what he has done is not tenable under the law and moreover the common principle of extending natural justice was also not adhered to. But state Congress president K. Sudhakaran, the biggest opponent of Vijayan, said there are very valid points raised by Khan. \"One needs to assess things which he has raised and all what he has raised just cannot be dismissed. There is merit in certain things that he has taken up with the state government,\" said Sudhakaran. State BJP president K. Surendran also did not lose any opportunity to take on Vijayan and also the Congress and pointed out that when it comes to attacking Khan, who was appointed by the Centre, these two political parties are hand in glove. The BJP will defend Khan, as he has done nothing wrong. --IANS sg/bg (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/guv-arif-keeps-blowing-hot-but-cm-pinarayi-says-this-is-kerala/","tags":[],"title":"Guv Arif keeps blowing hot, but CM Pinarayi says 'This is Kerala'"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"No end in sight to tug-of-war between Jharkhand Governor, Soren govt The role of Syed Sibte Razi had sparked intense controversy in 2005 when he administered the oath of chief ministership to Shibu Soren, the leader of the UPA\nTen Governors have been appointed in Jharkhand since it came into existence as a state about 22 years and 11 months ago. Of these, the tenure of Syed Sibte Razi, who was Governor between 2004 and 2009, and Ramesh Bais, the 10th Governor, will be remembered for political controversies. The role of Syed Sibte Razi had sparked intense controversy in 2005 when he administered the oath of chief ministership to Shibu Soren, the leader of the UPA, instead of the leader of the single largest party, the BJP, after the assembly election results. Soren had to resign after nine days as he was not able to prove his majority and then Arjun Munda was sworn in as CM. The tenure of the current Governor Ramesh Bais began on July 7, 2021. During his tenure of nearly one and a half years till now, there have been reports of differences, tensions and disagreements between Raj Bhavan and the state government on at least three-four occasions. For the past two months, a political tug of war has been going on between Governor Ramesh Bais and Chief Minister Hemant Soren over a letter from the Election Commission of India. This sealed letter reached Raj Bhavan in Ranchi from New Delhi on August 25. This letter is related to deciding the eligibility-disqualification of Chief Minister Hemant Soren, but even after 59 days it has not been officially disclosed what is the text of this letter. Soren and the state's ruling coalition have alleged that political uncertainty and confusion have been created due to non-disclosure of this letter. On the other hand, the Governor has publicly said that it is his discretion when and what decision he will take on this letter. No one should question this. The letter pertains to a case related to Hemant Soren's Office of Profit and alleged violation of the Representation of the People Act. Soren had taken a stone quarry on lease with an area of 88 decimils in his name in Anagada in Ranchi while being the Chief Minister. However, no mining work took place there and later Soren surrendered the lease. The BJP had complained to the Governor calling it a case of violation of the Office of Profit and Representation of the People Act. The Governor had sought the opinion of the Election Commission on this. The commission issued notice to the complainant and Hemant Soren and sought their response in this matter. After hearing both the sides, the Election Commission had sent its decision in a sealed cover to the Raj Bhavan on August 25. Unofficially, news has been doing the rounds that the Election Commission has recommended the cancellation of Hemant Soren's assembly membership considering him guilty and because of this he may lose his Chief Minister's chair. Amid the political suspense and confusion created by such reports, the ruling coalition had to undertake 'dinner diplomacy' and 'resort stay' to express solidarity with Hemant Soren . The ruling coalition also passed a motion of trust in Soren's favour in a special session of the assembly. Despite all this, the Governor has not yet revealed the contents of the letter and due to this the Hemant Soren government is going through a period of uncertainty about its future. On September 15, Soren met Bais and demanded that he clarify the situation regarding the letter of the Election Commission. He told the Governor that there is an atmosphere of uncertainty in the state. In such a situation, being the constitutional head of the state, he should take appropriate steps to protect democracy and the Constitution. The Chief Minister also requested the Governor in writing to provide him a copy of the decision sent by the Election Commission regarding his membership of the Assembly and the matter should be heard at the earliest. No response has been received from the Governor on this request so far. After this, on October 8, Vinod Pandey, the general secretary of the ruling party JMM, asked for a copy of the letter of the Election Commission by giving an application under the Right to Information Act at the Raj Bhavan. Along with the application, he also submitted a postal order of Rs 10. No response has been received on this as well. About a month ago, when asked what is in the letter of the Election Commission and when will it be opened, the Governor while avoiding the question in a light-hearted manner said that the envelope which has come from the Election Commission is stuck so hard that it is not opening. On October 15, Hemant Soren while talking to reporters at CM House said, \"I am the first Chief Minister of the entire country, who is going from the door of the Election Commission to the Governor, urging them to say if I have committed any crime, then what punishment has been given to me for it? I am asking him time and again that if I am really guilty, then how am I continuing in the post of Chief Minister?\" Hemant Soren also questioned the credibility and transparency of constitutional institutions by naming the Governor during the same press conference. He said that the way the central agencies are working, it seems that there is some power behind them, whose behest they are compelled to follow. Governor Ramesh Bais has raised questions many times in the last eight-ten months on the decisions of the government to the bills passed by the government in the assembly. In February, the Governor had raised many questions on the rules made by the state government regarding the formation of the Tribal Advisory Council (TAC). Bais had complained to the Centre saying that the rules made by the state government in June 2021 are contrary to the constitutional provisions and encroachment on the powers of the governor. He returned the TAC's manual and the file related to its formation to the state government and asked for changes in it. Even after months, there is a deadlock between the Raj Bhavan and the government on this matter. In the last few months, the Governor has returned half a dozen bills including the Anti-Mob Lynching Bill and the Krishi Mandi Bill passed by the state government in the Assembly. Recently, he also returned the bill passed by the government regarding the increase in court fees for reconsideration. During the review of the functioning of the tourism, cultural development, sports and youth affairs department last week, the governor expressed dissatisfaction and even remarked that a lack of vision was evident in the state. Overall, it can be said that there are many chapters yet to be written in the script of tension and confrontation between the Raj Bhavan and the state government in Jharkhand . --IANS snc/uk/bg (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/no-end-in-sight-to-tug-of-war-between-jharkhand-governor-soren-govt/","tags":[],"title":"No end in sight to tug-of-war between Jharkhand Governor, Soren govt"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Tussle between Punjab Governor, AAP govt over Ludhiana VC turns murkier The latest in a series of confrontations is Governor Purohit's directive to CM Bhagwant Mann to remove Satbir Singh Gosal from the post of Ludhiana-based Punjab Agricultural University Vice-Chancellor\nAn 'escalating tussle' between the constitutional head and the democratically elected Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Punjab has turned murkier with the former reminding the government that he took an oath to protect the Constitution and will not allow violation of rules. Without mincing words, Governor Banwarilal Purohit reminded the Bhagwant Mann-led government that in the past one year he didn't utter one word against any person. Rather he has been praising the Chief Minister. The latest in a series of confrontations is Governor Banwarilal Purohit's directive to Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann to remove Satbir Singh Gosal from the post of Ludhiana-based Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Vice-Chancellor. In a letter to the Chief Minister, the Governor termed Gosal's appointment as \"totally illegal\", saying he was appointed by the state government \"without following UGC norms and approval of the Chancellor\". The Governor is the chancellor of the PAU, the country's premier agricultural university established in 1962. The previous \"tussle\" between the duo was over the appointment of cardiologist Gurpreet Wander as Vice Chancellor of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, with the Governor saying the government violated the rules by recommending only one name. Wander later withdrew his candidature as Vice Chancellor. Justifying his decision to ask the government to withdraw the appointment of Gosal as Vice-Chancellor of the PAU, Purohit on Friday told the media in a formal interaction at Raj Bhavan that as the Chancellor of the universities he is performing his duty. \"Rather the government is interfering in his functioning. \"I will perform my duty. I have taken an oath to protect the Constitution. The Chief Minister should realise this. In fact, I administered the oath of office to the Chief Minister. He should not forget that.\" A day earlier the Chief Minister in a letter accused the Governor of \"constantly interfering\" in the government's functioning. Missing no opportunity to take a dig at the AAP government, currently facing Opposition pressure to drop cabinet minister Fauja Singh Sarari on corruption charges, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) said the government has played fraud with the constitutional head of the state as well as Punjabis by sending a letter to the Governor in English but releasing its forged and fabricated version in Punjabi on social media. SAD former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said the fraud had been perpetrated in the name of the Chief Minister along with his signature. \"The Chief Minister should disclose whether he was party to this act and whether it had his acquiescence. If not then the Chief Minister should get an FIR registered in the case and institute a high-level probe into the entire matter. \"Since the issue is also one of constitutional propriety, the SAD also urges the Governor to direct the Chief Minister to order an independent inquiry into the issue and ensure exemplary punishment for those guilty of forging documents as well as their dissemination.\" Cheema said the fact that neither the Chief Minister nor the AAP government had issued a clarification on the issue despite the matter being pointed out by the Governor himself indicated that the AAP was playing politics on the issue. The letter written by the Chief Minister to the Governor in Punjabi justifies the appointment of the PAU Vice-Chancellor. The signed letter, in circulation with the media, says the appointment of Gosal was done in accordance with the Punjab and Haryana Agricultural University Act of 1970. The Chief Minister said the appointment was the prerogative of the PAU board. Hence the Chief Minister or the Governor have no role. \"For the past few months, you have been constantly interfering in the functioning of the government, which was elected with a huge mandate. People of Punjab are very upset because of this,\" the letter quoting Mann said. Raj Bhavan responded on October 20 by clarifying that \"there is a letter in circulation in the media. This letter has not been received in Punjab Raj Bhavan till this moment\". However, it says, the letter received is in English and the contents of both the letters are materially different. Raj Bhavan has sought a clarification from the Chief Minister as to which of his two letters is authentic and why the letter written in Punjabi has been circulated to the media before and without sending it to Punjab Raj Bhavan. A day after the Governor asked the government to remove Gosal, Agriculture Minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal defended the appointment and accused the Governor of interfering in the government's functioning. Dhaliwal told the media here that the order of the Governor challenging the appointment was 'illegal' and said the appointment was made following all norms. Accusing the Governor of acting at the behest of the BJP, he said the Governor is taking unconstitutional action and his letter sent to the government was actually drafted at the BJP headquarters in Delhi. The minister said the AAP government would not tolerate any interference in its work. Dhaliwal said the PAU comes under the Haryana and Punjab Agriculture University Act 1970 and it does not come under the University Grants Commission. He said before taking any action, the Governor should have read the university Act and if it is an 'illegal appointment' then he should clarify why the post of the Vice Chancellor has been vacant for one year. \"The Governor is violating the dignity of his constitutional office. If he wants to do politics then there are elections in Gujarat and Himachal, he must contest elections there,\" Dhaliwal said. He added that the government appointed the two most deserving candidates for the post of two Vice Chancellors but both were objected to by the Governor, which clearly shows that he doesn't want the AAP to function for the development of Punjab and its people. Earlier, the 'rift' between the Governor and Chief Minister Mann was the former taking strong exception to the absence of the Chief Minister at the civic reception organised by him in honour of visiting President Droupadi Murmu. Reminding the Chief Minister of his constitutional obligations that have to be met on such occasions, the Governor, in the presence of President Droupadi Murmu, had said publicly from the stage: \"I had personally called him (Chief Minister) up, but he has not come apparently due to some compulsion.\" \"Whatever the compulsion, the constitutional obligations are more important and have to be fulfilled on such an occasion.\" Mann was also conspicuously absent at the Indian Air Force's 90th Air Show here on that day as he was on a political tour to poll-bound Gujarat along with AAP national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Earlier, the government took exception to the Governor's decision to seek details of legislative business for the Assembly session beginning on September 27. \"I want to ask the Governor to check the record of his office and tell the people how many governors have asked the government to provide information about the purpose of summoning an assembly session. Till today, no governor did it. Only he is doing so, because he is working at the behest of the BJP,\" Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema had said. Responding to the purported 'war of words', the Governor in a missive to the Chief Minister had said, \"Perhaps your opinion about me will definitely change after reading the provisions of Article 167 and 168 of the Constitution, which I'm quoting for your ready reference.\" Chief Minister Mann had clarified that the Governor or President's consent before any session of the legislature is a formality. \"In 75 years, no President or Governor ever asked list of legislative business before calling a session. Legislative business is decided by BAC (Business Advisory Council) and speaker. Next Governor will ask for all speeches also to be approved by him. It's too much,\" Mann had tweeted.

However, the actual implementation would come when the fresh batch of MBBS students begins in November. Three text books in Hindi have been released paving the way for its implementation. Since the day the three MBBS text books were released by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Bhopal, the implementation of this project has started a debate on the entire education system in Madhya Pradesh . The promotion of Hindi through its wider use has been a programme under the BJP government at the Centre as well as in Madhya Pradesh . The New Education Policy-2020 (NEP-2020) lays emphasis on the use of the mother tongue in imparting education. The Congress has questioned the timing of the project as the assembly elections in the state are scheduled in November-December 2023. The opposition has also questioned the implementation of the Hindi medium engineering courses. In 2016, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government started an engineering course in Hindi at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Hindi University in Bhopal. Technical engineering terms were translated from English to Hindi for the purpose. The programme found few takers, and the Congress claims the course has been discontinued. Medical Education Minister Vishwas Sarang, who is monitoring the project, countered the allegations claiming that implementation of Hindi in engineering and medical courses has put paid to the concept that technical and medical courses can only be in the English language. \"There was a fixed concept in mind that medical study can be done in English only, which has now started changing. We have introduced Hindi for engineering courses and the work is still underway, the time will come when people will accept it. These are things which cannot come overnight,\" Sarang said. Dr Vijalaxmi Sadho, who was medical education minister in the Kamal Nath-led Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and is an alumni of Gandhi Medical College, on being asked whether the MBBS course in Hindi is being implemented as a pilot project, accepted that students who come from a Hindi medium background face challenges. However, she believes that the government should have laid more emphasis on improving the education system at the school level, especially in the rural areas of the state. Talking exclusively to IANS, Sadho said, \"Our basic education system is poor and therefore implementation of Hindi or any other language would not achieve its real purpose until the children are imparted quality education. The Shivraj government said that exams should not be conducted for students upto the 9th class. Doing this you have ended a competitive system. In the rural areas, there are several students who have passed their primary level but they can't even write their name. That is why I would say that the government should focus on providing quality education, until then no concept will work.\" She alleged that around 1500 primary and secondary schools were closed in the last few years. She claimed that during the Congress rule between 1993 to 2003, the state had established thousands of primary and secondary schools at a distance of every three to five km. \"The Shivraj government closed over 1500 schools and now CM Rise schools are being established. There is a shortage of teachers at every school in Madhya Pradesh and the same situation prevails in government-run colleges and universities,\" Sadho added. She accused the BJP government of creating a conflict between Hindi and English for its political benefit. \"The BJP has been in power for the last 17 years and it never focused on improving the education system. Now, when the elections are getting closer, they are trying to divert attention from the real issues to hide their failure.\" Sadho, who was also a member of the Department of Public Health in Madhya Pradesh from 1993 to 1998, said, \"I accept that students who have studied in Hindi medium schools face difficulties when they come for higher education, especially in technical and medical courses, but this problem won't end with the introduction of Hindi.

The exercise also included a segment on the Atlantic coast of mainland France. POLARIS 21 was set up entirely in the context of operational preparation on several fronts and had a high combat intensity, which was fully in line with the strategic vision of the Chief of the Armed Forces and the Mercator Acceleration 21 plan of the Chief of Staff of the Admiral of the French navy Pierre Vandier. In addition to naval warfare, the exercise also included the participation of many combat aircraft and surface-to-air defense. Officially, the aim of the training was to test the capabilities of the sea and air elements to face future wars, using the latest systems and naval vessels to develop tactics. The scenario of the exercise was to “enable the Allies to maintain control of the Mediterranean in the event of threat from the Russian air force and navy”. Polaris 2021 “Exercise” The exercise scenario consisted of two troops (Blue and Red), BLUE consisting of the French Carrier Strike Group (CSG), centered around the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier FS Charles de Gaulle (R91), against a RED FORCES credible opposition force ( OPFOR), gathered around the Mistral-class left-hand drive ‘Tonnerre’. In total, the exercise saw the participation of 23 ships, one submarine, 65 aircraft and 6,000 personnel. Partner nations joining the exercise came from Greece, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The United States Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Porter (DDG 78), P-8A Poseidon aircraft from Commander, Task Force 67, and the Henry J. Kaiser-class fleet replenishment oiler USNS John Lenthal (T-AO 189) had a very important place in the “exercise“ POLARIS 2021. Also, U.S. Sixth Fleet, headquartered in Naples, Italy, conducted the full spectrum of joint and naval operations, often in concert with NATO partners, in order to strengthen the power of U.S. in Europe and Africa. The actual goal of the exercise However, journalists came into possession of data related to the exercise POLARIS 2021. The data speak clearly about the advance preparation of the NATO to enter into an armed conflict with the Russian Federation in the event of Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. According to the legend of the maneuvers, it was determined that in response to the alleged Russian intervention, the forces of the NATO coalition would form and send an aircraft carrier strike group led by the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier to the combat area in order to “stop the invasion and preserve the sovereignty of Ukraine.” The context and scenario of the “exercise“ (the consonance of the names of countries, settlements, the names of political figures, the specifics of maneuvers, etc.) became for the Russian Federation a signal of the real preparation of NATO to the start of hostilities against Russia, as it happened similarly to the operation of the United Defender alliance grouping of forces before the intervention in Libya (the exercises Baltops-2010 and Frisian Flag-2010), when, after the maneuvers at the sea ranges, a full-scale operation followed to overthrow of the legitimate government of Muammar Gaddafi. POLARIS 2021 was also a demonstration of NATO support to Kyiv in the event of an armed conflict with Russia and was supposed to push Kyiv to start hostilities with the Russian Federation, after which the intervention of the NATO was supposed.In principle, NATO was looking for an excuse to attack Russia, with the factor of surprise, so that Russia would not be ready for an adequate response. In this situation, the preventive start of the Special Military Operation of the RF Armed Forces in Ukraine became the only possible response to the inevitable aggression of the Kyiv regime and the NATO. There is no doubt that thanks to the Russian special operation in Ukraine and the fact that Russia launched a preventive strike, it was NATO that was surprised but also scared by the Russian determination to defend its interests. It is precisely this fact that is responsible for why there was not and will not be conflict between Russia and NATO, that is, the Third World War was prevented only thanks to the Russian special operation in Ukraine.

Photo: Special Arrangement The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the Uttarakhand government not to proceed with the Pakhro tiger safari project inside the Corbett Tiger Reserve until the Central committee submits its final report on the alleged illegal cutting of trees inside the reserve for the project. The NGT Bench consisting of Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, Justice Sudhir Agarwal and professor A Senthil Vel (expert member) maintained that the Forest Survey of India (FSI) report on the matter clearly acknowledges the illegality in cutting of trees. “Thus, accountability needs to be fixed for such violations and the damage to the environment restored, following due process of law. Accordingly, we constitute a three-member committee comprising the Director Generals of the Forest Department, Wildlife Department and Project Tiger to identify the violators and the steps required for restoration of environment,” the NGT said. It further ordered the State government not to proceed with tiger safari project until the committee submits its report with specific recommendations that may be furnished to the Secretary of the Ministry of Forest, Environment and Climate Change within one month. The report should also include steps for further course of action in the matter, the green Bench ordered. Earlier, Anoop Singh, Director General of Forest Survey of India, in his report to the NGT, had maintained that the area of sites where the trees were cut — as mentioned in the letter from the Uttarakhand government — has been calculated using the GPS survey done by the geographic information system (GIS) team of the FSI and Google Earth imagery. “The number of trees observed per hectare from all the inventory plots when multiplied with the area figures of a particular site gives the number of estimated trees felled at that particular site. By adding the estimated trees at different sites, total estimated number of trees felled are arrived in the study area,” the FSI told the NGT. It added that the standard error of estimates has come out to be 10.31 trees, which is within the acceptable limit.

The decision was taken to give relief to people during Diwali and it was being done under the guidance of Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, he said. In a tweet on Saturday, AIMIM chief Owaisi said, \"In 2021, Gujarat saw 15,200 road traffic accidents in which 7,457 people lost their lives. This 'revdi' bonanza by BJP Gujarat govt is putting people's lives at risk.\" Sanghavi hit back on Saturday without naming anyone, saying those who doing politics over the issue will get a befitting reply from middle-class citizens (during polls). \"Middle-class citizens go out during Diwali to do shopping with their family with whatever they have saved during the year. Many also go out on their two-wheelers with their aged parents. People many times forget to wear helmets or carry a driving license. Instead of collecting fine, we will give them a flower to make them realise their mistake,\" the minister said in Surat. The intention was to ensure that people's \"Diwali does not get spoiled\" due to traffic fines, he said. \"On the other hand, we do not consider racing by bikers on roads a mistake. This is an intentional crime. Gujarat police very well knows the difference between unintentional mistake and crime. Surat police have caught many such bikers in the last few days. So no one needs to teach us anything on that,\" Sanghavi asserted. Govatsa Dwadashi, celebrated on Friday, marked the beginning of the Diwali festival this year. Laxmi Pujan, the main day of the festival of lights, will be celebrated on October 24. Meanwhile, at a function in Science City in Ahmedabad on Friday, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel inaugurated or performed ground breaking for 16,359 projects and works worth Rs 3,338 crore.

The functions came shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi kick-started the recruitment drive for 10 lakh people in the next one year with the induction of 75,000 youth on the eve of Diwali. The jobs are being given directly by 38 separate Central ministries/departments, or vide UPSC, Railway Recruitment Board and State Service Commissioners, with a simplified tech-enabled, speedy recruitment process. Goyal, Rane and Athawale handed over the recruitment letters to hundreds of selected candidates in the Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard, Indian Posts, Indian Railways, Armed Forces Medical College, CISF, RCF, MDL, ITD, CBIC, ESIC, several public sector, regional and rural banks, IIT-Bombay, BSF and other organisations. The three Central ministers urged the new recruits to work with dedication in their new assignments to ensure fulfilling the PM's dream of a developed India in the next 25 years. The Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi allies Congress, Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena (UBT) slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government's decision to \"wake up after eight-and-half years\" with an eye on the ensuing states elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Congress Chief Spokesperson Atul Londhe said that the government is making big hue and cry over the 'job jamborees' held on Saturday when the fact is that the recruitment examinations and process for most of these posts were completed over two years ago but the candidates were not hired for making political gains later. NCP's Chief Spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said that compared with the 2-crore jobs promised by Modi when he took power, what is actually being offered after over 8 years is a pittance, that too with political motives. Terming it as \"another big hoax and hogwash\", SS (UBT)'s Spokesperson Kishore Tiwari said for giving just 75K appointment letters, Modi has taken eight-and-half years, that too before the elections in Gujarat, Haryana and other states. \"Where are vacancies in the State and Central government with automations or outsourcing or selling off valuable public sector assets? The PM's assurance of 2 crore jobs every year for his tenure of 10 years comes to 20 crore jobs. It will take a century to fulfil his promise at the current speed. The government is fooling the masses before the state and Lok Sabha polls,\" Tiwari added. Londhe said that over 22-crore youth have registered for employment on the government's Shram portal of which only 700,000 have got jobs, while the CMIE has said more than 45 crore people have given up hopes for any job opportunities. The Congress leader also targeted Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' statement promising to create 72,000 jobs in the state, and said the (state) government is not capable of even giving 72 jobs. Today's 'Rozgar Mela' saw the participation of union and state ministers, elected leaders and other officials in different parts of India. --IANS qn/pgh (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nbusiness-standard\n","permalink":"https://newsstreet.github.io/news/on-diwali-eve-800-maharashtra-youth-get-job-letters-mva-slams-bjp-govt/","tags":[],"title":"On Diwali-eve, 800 Maharashtra youth get job letters; MVA slams BJP govt"},{"categories":["politics"],"contents":"Shah meets with BJP leaders, workers of Gujarat to review poll preparations Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday held a meeting with BJP leaders and workers of south Gujarat zone to review preparations for the upcoming state Assembly elections, dates of which are yet to be announced.

Talking to media persons here, Congress spokesperson Alka Lamba said unemployment and inflation are key issues among people in the state. She alleged there is \"infighting in BJP families\" over ticket distribution. \"I recently visited the Mandi region. BJP Minister Mahender Singh Thakur is an example of BJP practicing dynastic politics as his son has been given a ticket. Daughter of Mahinder Singh has opposed ticket distribution,\" she said. Mahender Singh Thakur's daughter resigned from the post of general secretary of the BJP Mahila Morcha after the BJP decided to field her brother from the Dharampur seat in Mandi district where she was also an aspirant. On the chief ministerial face, Alka Lamba said this will be decided by the party's central leadership after consultations. \"People and workers of the Congress want to see their leaders as Chief Minister. I was in Bilaspur, the workers want Ram Lal Thakur should be CM, in Mandi workers want Kaul Singh Thakurji as CM. There are many other leaders like Sukhuji, MukeshJi and Pratibha Singhji. The voters, MLAs and party high command will decide the face of the Chief Minister,\" Alka Lamba said. She also took potshots at BJP over denying tickets to some MLA. \"Why 11 MLAs were denied tickets. Now nothing will change by changing candidates. People of state have made their mind to change the government,\" she said. \"We honour those leaders of a family who raise the voice of people. We respect the emotions and feelings of the workers, we don't control them like BJP. Family politics is not an issue in these elections, the key issues are unemployment and inflation,\" she added. Alka Lamba, who has been actively involved in Congress campaign in Himachal Pradesh, said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will embark on the second leg of her campaign on October 31. \"Priyanka Gandhiji will hold a rally in Mandi and a roadshow in Kullu on October 31. So far, we have announced 63 candidates and a decision on five tickets will also be taken soon. The Congress will declare its star campaigners list after October 25. The party is also bringing out a charge sheet against the government. We shall release our manifesto soon,\" Alka Lamba said. She alleged that the government in Himachal Pradesh is \"being run from Delhi through remote control.\" \"The development works in the state were stalled for five years,\" she alleged. Asked about state Congress chief Pratibha Singh not embarking on a major campaign, she said the priority was to finalize candidates for all 68 Assembly segments and added that all leaders were campaigning. Himachal Pradesh will go for elections on November 12 and the counting of votes will take place on December 8.
