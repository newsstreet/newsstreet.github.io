Upon arrival, he opened the box only to know that he has received a box full of e-waste and old computer parts. Just like some of us, he had only seen such frauds happening on social media platforms but witnessed it in real for the first time. Flipkart Plus user gets a giant stone and e-waste when ordered a gaming laptop On October 15th, Chinmaya ordered a gaming laptop, the Asus TUF Gaming F15, for his friend since he had a Flipkart Plus membership. The product was delivered on October 20, seal-packed from the outside. It wasn’t an open-box delivery like some of the items on Flipkart, but the buyer did share an OTP with the delivery person since the box looked just fine. However, when the main Flipkart packaging was opened, the Asus box inside was tampered and the barcodes and product details were removed. When the box was opened, there was everything but a laptop. It had old computer parts and e-waste along with a stone, which was apparently kept to keep the box heavy. As soon as this was learned by the buyer, he raised a return request which wasn’t approved by the seller. When the matter was known by Flipkart, it contacted the seller, however, the seller responded that the product was intact. Now, the buyer, Chinmaya, is in hopes that Flipkart investigates the issue as soon as possible and returns or refunds him. “I reported the same to Flipkart on the same day with all the proofs. They answered me that they need some time to get back with solution. On 23rd October they emailed me that the seller rejected the return request and the product is not at all damaged during the transportation,” said the buyer Chinmaya. This isn’t the first time that such scams are happening. Recently, a person ordered a laptop from Flipkart in the Big Billion Days sale but he received a detergent soap.

The New Orleans Pelicans are one of the whole four teams remaining in the Western Conference yet to lose a game. While the likes of Brandon Ingram, Jonas Valancuinas, and CJ McCollum have been balling out, the return of Zion Williamson has been extremely crucial for Willie Green and co. After missing out on the entire 2021-2022 campaign due to a foot injury, the 22-year-old averaged 11.3/3.3/2.8 in the 2022 preseason. Looking fitter than ever before, “Zanos” has been extremely dominant in NOLA’s first two outings.

In the clash between two undefeated teams, the main question is, will Williamson take on the floor tonight? Zion Williamson will look to dominate against the Jazz The former Duke Blue Devil has been sensational in the wins against the Nets \u0026 the Hornets. On 19th October, the 1-time All-Star wrecked havoc in the paint and recorded a 25-point, 9-rebound performance. View this post on Instagram A post shared by New Orleans Pelicans (@pelicansnba) In the bout against the Charlotte-based franchise, the highflyer put up 16 points in 31 minutes. NOLA fans can expect Zion to be a focal point during the Pels-Hornets clash, as he is expected to suit up on Sunday night. Unlike Kira Lewis Jr. (Out), E.J. Liddell (Out), and Jaxson Hayes (Questionable), Zion isn’t mentioned on the team’s injury report. Can NOLA go 3-0? The Pelicans haven’t disappointed yet. In the first two clashes, Brandon Ingram and co. have not yet trailed at any point. In the last 25 years, the Pels are only the fifth team to do so. The Pelicans are the fifth team in the last 25 years not to trail at any point in their first two regular season games, per @ESPNStatsInfo. The other four teams: – 2011-12 Hawks – 2004-05 Jazz – 2004-05 Heat – 1997-98 Hawks — Andrew Lopez (@_Andrew_Lopez) October 22, 2022 The big four of the Pels have been sensational so far. Agreed two games is a small sample space, however, averaging 92 PPG out of NOLA’s 127, must be satisfactory for Willie Green. pic.twitter.com/aWl8NK9SRl — Andrew Lopez (@_Andrew_Lopez) October 22, 2022 To be honest, it’ll be pretty easy for JV and “Zanos” to dominate the paint and boards while going up against the likes of Lauri Markkanen and Kelly Olynyk. There is a huge possibility that we see the New Orleans-based franchise grab the win on Sunday.
